For the Mark Williams C compiler:

Use the atarist.c file along with the source files in ../source.

This requires a version of curses (a screen management package) for the
Atari ST, use the one distributed here with the sources.

The sets.c file has some #pragma lines which will have to be deleted or
commented out, as the MWC preprocessor does not understand them.

*****

For the Turbo C compiler:

Use the atarist.c file along with the source files in ../source.

This requires a version of curses (a screen management package) for the
Atari ST, use the one distributed here with the sources.

Create a moria.prj file (or borrow the one from the ibmpc directory).
Link the files together to create the executable with the command
"TLINK -C=moria.lnk".  Use the Makefile.tc file for make.
Recommended options for the compile are "-P -G".

*****

For the Gnu C Compiler:

There are two major versions of the Run Time Library for the ST.
There are two makefiles, Makefile.bam if you use the Bammi RTL, and use
Makefile.roe if you use the Roede (sp?) RTL.  You do not need any system
definitions in config.h.  You will need the st-stuff.c file in this directory.
Do not use the curses sources in this directory, use the ones that come
with the GCC libraries.  The GCC port uses an environment variable
called MORIA_ROOT to find the misc files, as follows:
      If it is not set, or contains NULL then moria looks for a directory
   files/  - based in the CURRENT directory, for all auxillary files. If
   this subdirectory is not found, moria prints a error message and exits.
      If it is set, it should be a '/' terminated PATH. This PATH then has
   'files/' appended to it, thus forming the full search path for auxillary
   files. This allows the subdirectory 'files/' to be rooted anywhere, on
   any file system.
