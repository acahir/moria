This is the readme file for the Amiga port of Umoria.  Please keep this file
with any distribution of Umoria for the Amiga.

Version 5.5.1:   includes support for Lattice C from Ronald Cook.  Use
    the lmkfile for Lattice C, the makefile for Aztec C.

Version 5.3.1:   changed display to use Simon John Raybould's curses.  The
    version of the curses that was used in the binary distribution was 1.22
    with some modifications.  Because of this some of the bugs may be fixed
    and new bugs may have been created.  Please send any bug reports to me
    at (cgehman@hubcap.clemson.edu) or post on usenet in 
    rec.games.roguelike.moria.

The game detachs from the cli.  This was done so that the program can set
its own stack size.  You no longer have to set the stack higher.  I have
compiled the binary distribution with stack depth checking, if anyone
EVER gets the error "stack overflow!" tell me and I'll increase the stack
size.  As far as I can tell the program only uses about 20000 bytes and
I have set the stack to 30000, so it should be fine.

This game will work on 1 MB amigas with one disk drive.

For the game to work properly you must:

1)  The game looks for the amiga environment variables.  If you don't have
    env: set, you'll get a requester asking for it.

2)  If umoria is install on a hard disk, assign moria: to the directory where
    the binary and all of the support files are.  If the files are in
    "dh1:games/moria" type "assign moria: dh1:games/moria".


To compile the game:

1)  You must have Aztec C 5.0d or Lattice C.

2)  Copy all of the files in the subdirectories "amiga" & "source" together
    and type "make".  You must have the environment setup so that Aztec will
    find the include files and the large code libraries (cl.lib & ml.lib).

3)  If you do not want to use the assignment "moria:" to find the game, then
    you will have to change variables in "config.h" and "makefile".
