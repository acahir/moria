1.	To build Moria on the mac, you will need MPW C 3.0 or better.

2.	The top directory of the source distribution is denoted "{DistDir}"
	in the rest of this document.  It has as an immediate subdirectory
	"mac" which contains the file you are now reading, and an MPW script
	called "Install".

3.	The "Install" script configures the files of the source distribution
	for use with MPW.  It also creates a new directory on your disk into
	which the files required to build the game will be moved (since they
	are spread out across several directories as received).  Invoke this
	script as follows --

	a.	Set the directory to "{DistDir}mac"
	b.	Execute the command "Install {DistDir} {NewDir}" where "{NewDir}"
		is the name of the directory you want created to hold all the
		source required to build to mac version of the game.

4.	The mac version of the game uses two subroutine packages which must
	be built first as follows --

	a.	Set the directory to "{DistDir}mac:scrnmgr"
	b.	Build (cmd-B) "Install" (or execute "BuildProgram Install").
	c.	Set the directory to "{DistDir}mac:dumpres"
	d.	Build (cmd-B) "Install" (or execute "BuildProgram Install").

5.	Now the game can be built as follows --

	a.	Set the directory to "{NewDir}"
	b.	Build (cmd-B) "Moria" (or execute "BuildProgram Moria").
	c.	If Moria doesn't seem to work right, it is probably because
		the resource and text files weren't appended to the application.
		Either delete the file Moria and rebuild, or else execute by hand
		the commands which append the resources and text files.

*********

Moria can also be built with Think C now.
