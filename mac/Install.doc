Macintosh Build Instructions:
=============================

MPW C:
------
For MPW C, see Install.hqx (decompress it first, though).


THINK C 4.0:
------------

Make sure the directories are organized as follows:

           UMoria
              |
     +-----+-----+------+
     |     |     |      |
  files   doc   mac  source
                 |
             +-------+
             |       |
          dumpres  scrnmgr

1) Unpack DumpRes1.hqx, DumpRes2.hqx, MacMoria.hqx (the project) and 
   miscrsrc.hqx, and put them in the UMoria folder (or a folder above it).

2) Build the dumped resources:
	a) Exit :UMoria:source:config.h as follows:
		- Uncomment #define RSRC
		- Uncomment #define RSRC_PART1
	b) Build DumpRes1, and run it.  When given a command line, (ccommand
	   dialog) enter parameter MacMoria.dump.rsrc
	c) Recomment RSRC_PART1 and uncomment RSRC_PART2, and repeat b) with
	   DumpRes2.
	d) Recomment all resource '#define's so that the application can be
	   built.

3) Build standard resources:
	a) Duplicate the files :UMoria:mac:scrnmgr:scrnmgr.ro and 
	   :UMoria:mac:moria.ro, and put the copies in the same folder as
	   the project files.
	b) Use RMaker (which comes with THINK C) to compile scrnmgr.ro and
	   then moria.ro (the copies of them, that is).

4) Build the application: Load and build the project MacMoria.  Then
   build the application from it.

5) Add the help files to the application's data fork:
	a) Use ResEdit to change the type of MacMoria (the application)
	   to 'TEXT'.
	b) Make sure you have no active virus protection (GateKeeper Aid
	   gave me trouble at this stage).
	c) Load the MacMoria application into THINK C as a document.  It
	   should be blank.
	d) Place a copy of the contents of each of the files from 
	   :UMoria:files in this file.  Precede each one with a line of 
	   the form #<filename> (<filename> is just the base file name, eg
	   news or roglcmds.hlp).
	e) Use ResEdit to set the type back to 'APPL'.
	f) If you are experimenting with modifications, you can avoid this
	   lengthy process by changing the conditional in :UMoria:mac:mac.c,
	   function mac_helpfile() to #if 0, and create a seperate text
	   only file as described in d), named MacMoria.files.

6) Prepare manual:
	If you wish, you can load the manual (from :UMoria:doc) into a word-
	processor, and save it more neatly formatted.
