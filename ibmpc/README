To compile this program, you need a copy of PC-Curses, a screen management
package.  Sources for this are distributed separately, since most people
who need it already have a copy.

Or, if you have Turbo C, you can use the tcio.c file instead of PC-Curses.

*************************

CONFIG.DOC
	The MSDOS specific documentation file that came with PC-Moria 4.873.
	Much of this is out-of-date, and needs to be updated.  The section
	describing the MORIA.CNF configuration file is still useful.

MAKE.BAT, MLINK.LNK
	If you have MSC, you can compile the Umoria by executing this
	MAKE.BAT commands files, which uses MLINK.LNK to specify all of the
	files to be linked together to form the executable.

MORIA.CNF
	A sample configuration file for the MSDOS version of umoria 5.x.

Makefile, Makefile.XNX
	Obsolete Makefiles that were used for PC-Moria 4.873.  May still be
	useful as a reference though for those who want to write their own
	Makefiles.

TERMCAP
	A sample TERMCAP file which can be used by PC-Curses.

make
	A directory containing 3 makefiles for MSC.  Put the makefile.top
	file in the top directory (which contains the CHANGES file), put
	the makefile.src file in the source directory, and put the makefile.ibm
	in this directory.  Note that each file must be renamed to makefile
	when it is moved.  You can then build moria by running the MSC Make
	program in the top directory.

ms_ansi.c, ms_ansi.h, ms_misc.c
	MSDOS specific source files for umoria 5.x.

tcio.c
	For TC, this is an alternative io.c file.  If you use this file
	instead of source/io.c, then you don't need PC-Curses.  This should
	result in a smaller, faster program.

turbo_c.inf
	Some hints on compiling Umoria with TC.

umoria.prj
	A project file to be used when compiling Umoria with TC.
