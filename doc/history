A History of Moria: written by Jim Wilson
	This history is somewhat biased towards the Umoria versions because
	those are the versions that I am most familiar with; info for the
	VMS versions, in particular, may be inaccurate.

Moria 4.8:
	The last version developed by the original authors, R.A. Koeneke,
	etc., at the Univ Oklahoma.  This is written in VMS Pascal, and
	is only available for VAX/VMS systems.  All other versions of moria
	are based on this program.  (Sometimes referred to as VMS Moria	4.8.)

Moria UB 5.0:
	This version was developed at Univ Buffalo, hence the UB in the name.
	This is also written in VMS Pascal, and is only available for VAX/VMS
	systems.  Some of the distinguishing features of this version are:
	a Black Market where one can purchase highly enchanted magic items at
	100 times normal value, monsters on the town level worth negative
	experience (Mother and Baby, Small Child), `shadow' Balrogs start
	appearing at level 50 with the `real' Balrog at level 1200 (this makes
	it a bit difficult to win).  There are also some new items, and many
	more new monsters.  (Sometimes referred to as VMS Moria 5.0 or
	Moria 5.0.  Should not be confused with Umoria 5.x.)  This is based
	on the Moria 4.8 sources.
Moria UB 5.1:
	The latest version of UB Moria.  This version is not available outside
	Univ Buffalo as yet, and I do not know what any of the new features
	are.  Only available for VAX/VMS systems.

VMS Moria 6.0:
	This version was under development at Villanova by Rick Greene.
	However, it was never completed and was never released.  I believe
	that it was abandoned because Rick lost computer and/or network access.
	This was based on the Moria UB 5.0 sources.

Imoria:
	This version was developed at the Univ. Washington.  It is written
	in VMS Pascal, and is only available for VAX/VMX systems.  
	I know very little about this version, but have been told by people
	at U Washington that it is far superior to any other Moria version
	that currently exists.  It has many new monsters, new objects,
	new races, new classes, new terrain types (like water), etc.
	The sources are currently available from UBVMS.
Imoria 4.9:
	The latest version of Imoria.

PC-Moria 4.00+:
	This version is a port of the Moria 4.8 Pascal sources to the IBM-PC
	by John W. DeBoskey.  This is a faithful port of the original game,
	unfortunately, this version has quite a few bugs and hence is not
	as good as the unrelated PC-Moria 4.87 version.

Umoria (UNIX Moria) 4.83/4.85/4.87:
	This version was developed by Jim Wilson at UC Berkeley.
	It is written in UNIX/C and is much more portable than the original
	sources.  These sources, at one time or another, were ported to VMS,
	IBM-PC, Atari ST, Amiga, Macintosh, Apple IIGS, VM/SP, Archimedes,
	are probably others too.  This version fixes very many bugs, spelling
	errors, and inconsistencies in the original Moria 4.8 sources.
	This version has no help facility like the original program.  It has
	character rerolling (in the later versions), but few other changes
	from the original game.  (This version has many names, e.g.
	Umoria 4.87, UNIX Moria 4.87, PC-Moria 4.83, PC-Moria 4.873, Mac Moria
	4.87, etc.  Just about anything with a .83/.85/.87 in the name is
	a version of this program.)  This is based on the Moria 4.8 sources.

PC-Moria 4.83/4.873:
	This version was developed by Don Kneller, based on the Umoria sources.
	These sources are identical except that they will compile on machines
	with 16 bit integers, had many changes to reduce program size,
	and introduced the reduced map display.  (Note: PC-Moria 4.83 is
	extremely buggy, and is unplayable.  I strongly recommend that you
	upgrade to a newer version if you are still playing it.)

Amiga Moria v3.0:
	This version was written by Richard and Bryan Henderson of Kettering,
	Ohio.  It is based on the Umoria 4.85 sources.  This version
	has bitmapped graphics, unlike the ascii graphics of all other
	versions.  It has weapons of Godly Might (which make one practically
	invicible) and some other changes that make it far far easier than
	all other Moria versions.  It also has several new monsters, such
	as Lavender Leprechauns.  Sources for this version were never
	released.

BRUCE Moria:
	This version was developed by Christopher J. Stuart at Monash
	University, Clayton, Victoria Australia.  This version has many
	great new features: monster memories, look any direction code,
	settable options, better run/find code, can center character on
	screen, stat code rewritten to fix bugs, rudimentory help facility
	added, plus many other enhancements.  This was considered an
	experimental version, and source never publicly released.  This
	was based on the Umoria 4.85 sources.

UMoria 5.x:
	This version is under developement by Jim Wilson at Cygnus Support.
	It has unified source for the UNIX/IBM-PC/Atari/Mac/VMS/Amiga ports
	of Umoria 4.87.  It includes many new features borrowed from BRUCE
	Moria, many more bug fixes, all floating point code eliminated,
	many changes that affect play balance (hopefully for the better),
	many type/structure changes to reduce game size and allow fixes for
	pervasive bugs.  See the doc/FEATURES.NEW file for a list of most
	user visible changes.  (Sometimes called Umoria 5.0, Moria 5.0,
	Moria 5.x.  Should not be confused with Moria UB 5.0.)
Umoria 5.6
	The latest version of Umoria 5.x.  David Grabiner has taken over 
        Umoria 5.x development but has made only minor changes.  Umoria 5.6
        is released under the GNU General Public License.

Vertical position indicates roughly when the versions were made available,
although the scale is not very accurate.
