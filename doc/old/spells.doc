1.  Magic Spells

All player characters except Warriors are able to learn some form of
magic spells.  There are two kinds of magic, Magic spells, which Mages,
Rogues, and Rangers get, and prayers, which Priests and Paladins have.
Each spell has a minimum level required for learning it, a mana score,
which is the mana points required to cast it, and a failure percentage.

Mana points are determined by your experience level, and the level of
your key stat.  For Mages, Rogues, and Rangers, the key stat is intelligence,
for Priests and Paladins the key stat is wisdom.  The effect of your key
stat is shown by the following table.

             Stat Level                 Factor
                3-7                       0
                8-17                      1
               18-18/49                  3/2
            18/50-18/69                   2
            18/70-18/89                  5/2
            18/90-18/99                   3
               18/100                     4

Your Mana score is the Factor times your experience level plus 1.
If your key stat is 7 or less, your Mana score will be zero (not one)
and you will not be able to use any spells.  If you attempt to cast a
spell that calls for more Mana than you have, the rate of failure is much
greater than normal, you will faint for a few turns afterward, and you stand
the chance of damaging your health.

1.1  Priest Spells

Priest spells are received from the character's deity.  When the 'G'
command is issued to learn new spells, spells are chosen randomly from
the spells that you are able to cast.  You need not
have the book the spell is in to learn it, because your God gave it to you,
but you do need the book to cast the spell.  Failure percentages and spell
effectiveness are based on Wisdom for priests and paladins.

1.2  Mage Spells

Mage Spells are more powerful and offensive in nature than Priest
spells.  This offsets the fact that magicians are generally weaker
than any other class.  Because mage spells are learned though
study, you must have the correct Magic book to learn and cast a
spell.  Learning spells can be banked up.  For example:  You are a
second level Mage who had learned Magic Missile and can learn one
more spell.  You do not wish to learn Detect Monsters, Phase Door
or Light Area.  You can wait until you are third level and learn
both the Cure Light Wounds and Stinking Cloud, both third level
spells.  Spell failure and effectiveness is based on intelligence
for Mages, Rangers, and Rogues.  Rangers can learn all but the most
powerful offensive spell.  Rogues can not learn any offensive spell.

1.3  Using Offensive Spells Against Monsters

Monsters have a chance to save themselves from damage caused by
offensive spells, just like the player has a chanced to be saved from
damage by monster spells.  This chance is greater for higher level
monsters than for lower level monsters.  Also, some spells will never
work against monsters whose level is higher than the character's
experience level.

Many monsters are immune to certain kinds of attack, and will suffer little
or no damage from such attacks.  For example, a fire breathing dragon will
suffer little damage from a fire ball, but will suffer greatly from a
frost ball.  Also, Undead creatures will not be affected by sleep spells,
since they never sleep.
