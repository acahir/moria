1.  Experience

All characters receive experience during the game.  Experience
determines your level, which determines hit points, mana points,
spells, abilities, etc.  The amount of experience required to 
advance a level is a base value (shown below) plus a penalty
for race and class.

1.1  Calculating Experience Levels

Base Experience

Lv   Exp to Adv     Lv   Exp to Adv     Lv   Exp to Adv
 1      10          14    1,400         27      35,000
 2      25          15    1,800         28      50,000
 3      45          16    2,300         29      75,000
 4      70          17    2,900         30     100,000
 5     100          18    3,600         31     150,000
 6     140          19    4,400         32     200,000
 7     200          20    5,400         33     300,000
 8     280          21    6,800         34     400,000
 9     380          22    8,400         35     500,000
10     500          23   10,200         36     750,000
11     650          24   12,500         37   1,500,000
12     850          25   17,500         38   2,500,000
13   1,100          26   25,000         39   5,000,000

Maximum level is 40 and maximum experience is 9,999,999

There are percent penalties for various races and classes to
help even them out.  The table below lists all the penalties.

      Human       0%     Warrior    0%
      Half-Elf   10%     Mage      30%
      Elf        20%     Priest    20%
      Halfling   10%     Rogue      0%
      Gnome      25%     Ranger    40%
      Dwarf      20%     Paladin   35%
      Half-Orc   10%
      Half-Troll 20%

For example:  For a 10'th level Gnomish Mage to achieve 11'th level
needs:
           500 *  1.25 * 1.30 = 812.5
         (base) (gnome) (mage)

Note:  Even for the worst case (Gnomish Ranger) it is still possible
to achieve the 40th level.  (5,000,000*1.25*1.40=8,750,000 experience)

The program internally keeps experience out to the fourth decimal place
even though it only displays the integer portion on the screen.

1.2  Getting Experience

There are many ways to gain experience.  This list shows a few.

1.  Defeating monsters
2.  Disarming traps
3.  Picking locks
4.  Using a scroll, potion, staff, wand, or rod for the first time
      and discovering what it did.
5.  Casting a spell successfully for the first time.
6.  Drinking a potion of gain experience or gain level

1.3  Titles

and class.  Below is a listing of all the titles for each level and
