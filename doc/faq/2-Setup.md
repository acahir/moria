## I can't get Moria set up on my machine.

There is a bbs at bbs.runet.edu which has Moria and Angband installed. To play either game, telnet to bbs.runet.edu, and login as bbs to set up an account.

If possible, please try to set up Moria or Angband yourself first, to avoid overloading the BBS.  The game will also play better on your own machine, because there will be no network delays.

This BBS is maintained by Brian Kirouac, bri@entropic.com; please mail any questions or problems to him, not to me.

You can also play Umoria version 4.87 by telnet to herx1.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de; login as games.  Note that this site is in Germany, which makes access from North America very slow; European users might want to try it.
