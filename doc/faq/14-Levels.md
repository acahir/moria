## On what level do you find X?

In 5.1 and all later versions, 1/12 of items are chosen as if you were on a deeper level, which has (current level/50) chance of being level 50; this check is not made in town.  This affects only the type of item, not its enchantment.

Items become somewhat less common as you go deeper than the indicated levels; however, if you can survive down there, this is compensated for by the fact that there are more treasures on deeper levels.
