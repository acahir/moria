## How much damage do spells and wands do?

|Spell Name              |5.1.0 and later damage
|------------------------|:----------------------
|Magic Missile           |2d6
|Stinking Cloud          |12
|Lightning Bolt          |4d8
|Lightning Ball          |32
|Frost Bolt              |6d8
|Frost/Cold Ball         |48
|Acid Ball               |60
|Fire Bolt               |9d8
|Fire Ball               |72
|Wand of Drain Life      |75 [in 5.1.4 and later]

In 5.x only, a wand of wall building will do 4d8 damage to any creature buried in the wall (except one that moves through walls), and will kill any immobile creature.  On the creature's next turn, it will attempt to move out of the wall, and if it is unable to do so, it will take 10d8 damage and dig its way out.

Everything below is the same in all versions.

|Wand                    | Damage
|:-----------------------|:-----------------
|Wand of Light/Staff of  |2d8 (if sensitive)
|Starlight               |
|Stone to Mud		         |100 (if sensitive)
|Orb of Draining         |3d6 + caster's level, double to evil creatures
|Dispel Undead/Evil      |1-60 from scroll or staff; 1 up to triple caster's level from spell
|Holy Word               |Dispel evil for 1 up to quadruple caster's level

Notes:
All mage spells in 4.87 do the damage listed in the table above if cast from a wand, and 1 point more if cast by a mage.

All ball spells do full damage for a direct hit, half damage one space away, and 1/3 damage two spaces away.
