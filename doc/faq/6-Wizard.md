## How do I use wizard mode, and what can I do in it? 

In Umoria 5.x, anyone can use wizard mode by typing ^W.  However, characters who play in wizard mode are permanently barred from the scoreboard; wizard mode should be used only for debugging and experimenting.

Additional information is available in the [spoilers documentation](../spoilers/index.html).

In 4.87 on Unix systems, only the person who installed the game can use wizard mode; if you are the installer, the passwords are in the source file constants.h.

In PC-Moria 4.8x, you need to know the passwords to use wizard mode, and the password will depend on who compiled your game.

4.87 has both wizard and god modes; 5.x's wizard mode is equivalent to the old god mode.  The 4.87 wizard mode allows you to do only things related to the game (cure all problems, teleport, identify).  The 5.x wizard mode and 4.87 god mode allow you to test the program by editing your character, creating objects, deleting monsters, and similar things.

In wizard mode, ^H or DELETE will give you a list of the available commands.
