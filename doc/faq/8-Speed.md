## How does speed work?

Very Fast is the highest speed that can be displayed, but if you are fortunate enough to find several speed items, you can get still faster. Permanent speed items (rings and boots) are cumulative, and temporary speed (potions, spells, and staffs) can add one more point to your speed.  Multiple uses of temporary speed are cumulative only in duration.
