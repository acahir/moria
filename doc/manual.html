<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The game of <em>moria</em> is a single player dungeon simulation.  A
player may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a 
character, and then <em>run</em> that character over a period of
days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating
the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.
</p>
<p>The character will begin the adventure on the town level where 
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices can be acquired by bartering 
with various shop owners.  After preparing for this adventure, the 
character can descend into the dungeons of <em>moria</em> where fantastic adventures 
await!
</p>
<p>Before beginning an adventure, this document should be read
carefully.  The game of <em>moria</em> is a complicated game (but not as complicated as other roguelikes), and will require a dedicated player to win.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Running-The-Game"></a>
<a name="Running-The-Game-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 Running The Game</h2>

<pre class="verbatim">moria [ -o ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -S ] [ -n ] [ -w[seed] ] [ savefile ]
</pre>
<p>By default, <em>moria</em> will save and restore games from a file called
moria.save in the home directory.  If the environment variable
MORIA_SAV is defined, then <em>moria</em> will use that file name instead of the
default.  If MORIA_SAV is not a complete path name, then the savefile
will be created or restored from the current directory.  The savefile can also be explicitly specified on the command line.
</p>
<p>When the -n option is used, <em>moria</em> will create a new game, ignoring any
savefile which may already exist.  This works best when a savefile name
is specified on the command line, as this will prevent <em>moria</em> from trying
to overwrite the default savefile (if it exists) when saving a game.
</p>
<p>Movement in various directions is accomplished by pressing the numeric keypad 
keys, VMS-style.  When -r is specified, movement is accomplished in the same way as rogue.  When -o is specified, it forces the VMS-style command set.
These options will override defaults stored in the savefile.  If these
options are given multiple times, only the last one will take effect.
</p>
<p>When -s is specified, <em>moria</em> displays all of the scores in the score file and exits.  On a multiuser system, when -S is specified, <em>moria</em> displays
only those scores belonging to the current user and then exits.
</p>
<p>When -w is specified, <em>moria</em> will start up in wizard mode.  Dead characters can be resurrected using this option when starting the game.
Resurrected characters are teleported to the town level and given zero
hit-points.  Wizard mode is intended for debugging the game, and for
experimenting with new features.  To make random events happen in a predictable
manner a seed number can be given to the -w option.  Using wizard mode to win 
the game is considered cheating.  Games played with wizard mode are not scored.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="The-Character"></a>
<a name="The-Character-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">3 The Character</h2>
<p>All characters have six main attributes which modify their basic
abilities.  These six attributes, called <em>stats</em>, are <em>strength</em>,
<em>intelligence</em>, <em>wisdom</em>, <em>dexterity</em>, 
<em>constitution</em>, and <em>charisma</em>.
Stats may vary from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 18.  At the
highest level, stats are further qualified by a number from zero
to one hundred, so that the highest value is actually 18/100.  A
value of 18/100 can be thought of as equivalent to 19, and 18/00
(not actually used) is equivalent to 18.  Because adventurers of
interest tend to be better than average characters, <em>moria</em> stats
will average about 13, and are further adjusted by race and
class.  Some races are just naturally better at being certain
classes, as will be shown later.
</p>
<p>In addition to the more visible stats, each character has certain
abilities which are mainly determined by their race, class, and
level, but are also modified by their stats.  The abilities are
<em>fighting</em>, <em>throwing/bows</em>, <em>saving throw</em>, 
<em>stealth</em>, <em>disarming</em>, <em>magical devices</em>, <em>perception</em>, 
<em>searching</em>, and <em>infravision</em>.
</p>
<p>Characters will be assigned an early history, with money and a
social class based on that history.  Starting money is assigned
based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the average of a
character&rsquo;s stats.  A character with below average stats will
receive extra money to help them survive the first adventure.
</p>
<p>Each character will also have physical attributes such as race,
height, weight, sex, and a physical description.  None of these,
except weight, play any part in the game other than to give the
player a &quot;feeling&quot; for their character.  Weight is used for computing 
carrying capacity and also for bashing.
</p>
<p>Finally, each character is assigned <em>hit-points</em> based on their
race, class, and constitution.  Spell casters will also receive
<em>mana</em> which is expended when casting spells.  Mana is based on
Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Character-Stats"></a>
<a name="Character-Stats-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Character Stats</h3>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>Strength</code></dt>
<dd><p>Strength is important in fighting with weapons and hand to
hand combat.  A high strength can improve the chances of
hitting, and the amount of damage done with each hit.  Characters 
with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
is also useful in tunneling, body and shield bashing, and in
carrying heavy items.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Intelligence</code></dt>
<dd><p>Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage, or magician.  A
high intelligence increases a mage&rsquo;s chances of learning
spells, and it also increases the amount of mana a mage has.
No spell may be learned by mages with intelligences under 8.
Intelligence also modifies a character&rsquo;s chance of disarming
traps, picking locks, and using magic devices.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Wisdom</code></dt>
<dd><p>Wisdom is the prime stat of a priest.  A high wisdom
increases the chance of receiving new spells from a priest&rsquo;s
deity, and it also increases the amount of mana a priest
has.  No spell may be learned by priests with wisdom under
8.  Wisdom also modifies a character&rsquo;s chance of resisting
magical spells cast upon their person.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Dexterity</code></dt>
<dd><p>Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing kill power, and
may increase the chances of hitting with any weapon and
dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
picking locks, disarming traps, and protection from
pick pockets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Constitution</code></dt>
<dd><p>Constitution is a character&rsquo;s ability to resist damage to
the body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
character with a high constitution will receive more hit
points, and be more resistant to poisons.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Charisma</code></dt>
<dd><p>Charisma represents a character&rsquo;s personality, as well as
physical looks.  A character with a high charisma will
receive better prices from store owners, whereas a character
with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.  A high
charisma will also mean more starting money for the character.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<hr>
<a name="Character-Sex"></a>
<a name="Character-Sex-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Character Sex</h3>
<p>The player may choose to be either a male or a female character.  Only
height and weight are affected by a character&rsquo;s gender.  Female
characters tend to be somewhat smaller and lighter than their
male counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made
because of the gender of a character.  Female characters start out
with slightly more money than male characters to help offset the
weight penalty.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Character-Abilities"></a>
<a name="Character-Abilities-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Character Abilities</h3>
<p>Characters possess nine different abilities which can help them
to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon
race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats,
and may increase with the level of the character.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>Fighting</code></dt>
<dd><p>Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
fists.  Normally a character gets a single blow from any
weapon, but if their dexterity and strength are high enough,
they may receive more blows per round with lighter weapons.
Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
opponent.  This skill increases with the level of the character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Throwing/Bows</code></dt>
<dd><p>Using ranged missile weapons and throwing objects is
included in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an object
is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the level of
the character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Saving Throw</code></dt>
<dd><p>A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
effects of a spell cast on them by another person or creature.
This does not include spells cast on the character by their own
stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
increases with the level of the character, but then most
high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it
tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this ability.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Stealth</code></dt>
<dd><p>The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Characters 
with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice
a stealthy character entirely, allowing a character to avoid
certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race and
class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Disarming</code></dt>
<dd><p>Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and
includes picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful
disarming will gain the character some experience.  A trap
must be found before it can be disarmed.  Dexterity and
intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and this
ability increases with the level of the character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Using Magical Devices</code></dt>
<dd><p>Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires
experience and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and
priests are therefore much better at using a magical device
than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
and increases with the level of the character.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Perception</code></dt>
<dd><p>Perception is the ability to notice something without
actively seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon
race and class, and will never improve unless magically
enhanced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Searching</code></dt>
<dd><p>To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
and traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
mages, rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
improve unless magically enhanced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Infravision</code></dt>
<dd><p>Infravision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most
of the dungeon is cool or cold, infravision will not allow
the character to see walls and objects.  Infravision will allow
a character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain 
distance.  This ability works equally well with or
without a light source.  The majority of <em>moria</em>&rsquo;s creatures
are cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by
a light source.  All non-human races have innate infravision
ability.  Humans can gain infravision only if it is magically 
enhanced.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<hr>
<a name="Choosing-A-Race"></a>
<a name="Choosing-A-Race-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.4 Choosing A Race</h3>
<p>There are eight different races that can be chosen from in
<em>moria</em>.  Some races are restricted as to what profession they may
be, and each race has its own adjustments to a character&rsquo;s stats
and abilities.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>Human</code></dt>
<dd><p>The human is the base character, all other races are compared 
to this race.  Humans can choose any class, and are average
at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
other race, because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
adjustments occur to characters choosing human.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Half-Elf</code></dt>
<dd><p>Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but
not as strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they are not
as good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Elf</code></dt>
<dd><p>Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either
humans or half-elves, and also have better wisdom.  Elves
are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and
magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  Elves may
choose any class except Paladin.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Halfling</code></dt>
<dd><p>Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing, and
have good saving throws.  They also are very good at searching, 
disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent 
thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...).  They
will be much weaker than humans, and no good at bashing.
Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
creatures at a distance.  Halflings can choose between being
a warrior, mage, or rogue.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Gnome</code></dt>
<dd><p>Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger than halflings.
They, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
homes.  Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill
something in a humorous way, so much the better.  Gnomes
make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws.
They are good at searching, disarming, perception, and
stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they are
not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes have
fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a
distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior, mage,
priest, or rogue.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Dwarf</code></dt>
<dd><p>Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves tend to
be stronger and have higher constitutions, but are slower
and less intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong 
and are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are
cast on them.  Dwarves also have good infravision because
they live underground.  They do have one big drawback
though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud
voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming 
out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words,
dwarves have a miserable stealth.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Half-Orc</code></dt>
<dd><p>Half-Orcs make excellent warriors, and decent priests, but
are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at
stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.  
Half-Orcs are, let&rsquo;s face it, ugly.  They tend to pay
more for goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good priests and
rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have
great constitutions and lots of hit-points.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Half-Troll</code></dt>
<dd><p>Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest hit
points of any character race.  They are also very stupid and
slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
They also happen to be fun to run...
</p>

<h3 class="section">3.5 Choosing A Class</h3>
<p>Once a race has been chosen, the player will need to pick a class.  Some
classes will not be available to certain races, for instance, a
Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin.  Players who are new to the game 
should run a warrior or rogue.  Spell casting generally requires a more 
experienced player that is familiar with survival techniques.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>Warrior</code></dt>
<dd><p>Warriors are hack-and-slash characters, who solve most of
their problems by cutting them to pieces, but occasionally 
falls back on the help of magical devices.  Their prime
stats are Strength and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at Fighting 
and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Mage</code></dt>
<dd><p>Mages must live by their wits.  They cannot hope to simply hack
their way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use their
magic to defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape.  Mages are
not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
to use in addition to their spells.  They can master the higher
level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and has
the best saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at
them.  Intelligence and Dexterity are their primary stats.
There is no rule that says a mages cannot become good
fighters, but spells are their true realm.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Priest</code></dt>
<dd><p>Priests are characters of holy devotion.  They explore the
dungeon only to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
treasure just happens to fall into their pack, well, so much
more to the glory of their temple!  Priests receive their
spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
spells are learned.  They are familiar with magical devices,
preferring to call them instruments of god, but is not as
good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good saving
throws, and make decent fighters, preferring blunt weapons
over edged ones.  Wisdom and Charisma are the priest&rsquo;s
primary stats.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Rogue</code></dt>
<dd><p>Rogues are characters that prefer to live by their cunning,
but is capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot.  They
are the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible
to overcome.  A rogue has a high stealth allowing
them to sneak around many creatures without having to fight,
or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue&rsquo;s perception is
higher than any other class, and many times they will notice a
trap or secret door before having to search.  A rogue is
better than a warrior or paladin with magical devices, but
still cannot rely on their performance.  Rogues can also
learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive spells
mages can use.  A rogue&rsquo;s primary stats are Intelligence and
Dexterity.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Ranger</code></dt>
<dd><p>A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  They are good fighters, and the
best of the classes with a missile weapon such as a bow.
Rangers learn spells much more slowly than a mage, but
is capable of learning all but the most powerful spell.
Because rangers are really a dual class character, more
experience is required for them to advance.  Rangers have
good stealth, good perception, good searching, good saving
throw, and is good with magical devices.  Their primary stats
are Intelligence and Dexterity.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Paladin</code></dt>
<dd><p>A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  They are very good fighters,
second only to the warrior class, but are not very good at missile 
weapons.  They receive prayers at a slower pace then the
priest, but can eventually learn all the prayers.  Because
paladins are dual class characters, it requires more
experience to advance them.  A paladin lacks much in the way
of abilities.  They are poor at stealth, perception, searching,
and magical devices.  They have a decent saving throw due to
their divine alliance.  A paladin&rsquo;s primary stats are Strength and
Charisma.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Adventuring</h2>
<p>After the character has been created, their dungeon adventure can begin.
Symbols appearing on the screen represent the
dungeon walls, floor, objects, features, and creatures lurking
about.  In order to direct the character through their adventure,
the player will enter single character commands.
</p>
<p><em>Moria</em> symbols and commands each have a help section devoted to
them.  The player should review these sections before attempting an
adventure.  Finally, a description of the town level and some
general help on adventuring are included.

<a name="Symbols-On-The-Screen"></a>
<a name="Symbols-On-The-Screen-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">5 Symbols On The Screen</h2>
<p>Symbols on the map can be broken down into three categories:
</p><ol>
<li> Features of the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps.
</li><li> Objects which can be picked up such as treasure, weapons, armor, magical
devices, etc.
</li><li> Creatures which may or may not move about the
dungeon, but are mostly harmful to the character&rsquo;s well-being.
</li></ol>

<p>Some symbols can be in more than one category.  Also note that
treasure may be embedded in a wall, and the wall must be removed
before the treasure can be picked up.
</p>
<p>It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and their
meanings.  A simple command, the <code>/</code>, will identify any symbol
appearing on the map.  See the section on commands for further
help.

</pre>
<p>The top line is where messages appear about what&rsquo;s happening in the game.  The bottom line is a status line, that shows what dungeon depth the character is at, and other things like if the character is hungry, afraid, poisoned, or moving especially slow or fast.  On the left side of the screen the character&rsquo;s stats can be seen.  Everything else, is the map of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>This picture shows an elf mage character (<code>@</code>) in a lit room at 1000 feet below the surface.  The walls of the room (<code>#</code>) can be seen, and the empty lit tiles within it (<code>.</code>).  The room has one closed door (<code>+</code>), and one open door (<code>'</code>), and three other ways to leave.  The character has arrived to this room through a tunnel or hall coming from the top of the screen.  The tunnel is not lit like the room is.  The tunnel will be lit by the character&rsquo;s light source as it travels through.  There are no monsters visible.
</p>
<p>From the statistics on the left side of the screen, it can be seen that the character is a <code>Mage (2nd)</code>, which is another way of saying that it is at level 27.  The reason that this character is at level 27 is because it has 38487 experience points.
</p>
<p>The character has 123 of 123 hit-points available.  <code>HP</code> shows the current hit points and then the maximum hit-points.  This spell-caster has exactly 66 mana (spell-casting) points to spend as spells are cast.  It can also be seen that this mage has some spells to learn.  The word <code>Study</code> in the bottom right shows this.
</p>
<p>The character&rsquo;s current levels of strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma can also be seen.  The character doesn&rsquo;t have 18 of 78 intelligence, they have 18 78/100 intelligence, which is more than just 18.
</p>
<p>Finally, the character&rsquo;s armor class is currently at 55, and has a great number of gold pieces.

<a name="Commands"></a>
<a name="Commands-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">6 Commands</h2>
<p>All commands are entered by pressing a single key.  Some commands
are capital or control characters, which require the player to hold down
the shift or control key while pressing another key.  As a special 
feature, control keys may be entered in a single keystroke, or
in two keystrokes, with a <code>^</code> character first.
</p>
<p>There are two command sets: the original command set which is the
default (e.g. the original VMS-style command set), and the rogue-like 
command set.  The rogue-like command is generally more convenient, 
especially if the keyboard lacks a keypad.
</p>
<p>The following tables summarize the two command sets.  Certain
commands may be preceded by an optional count, and certain commands 
must be followed by a direction.  These conditions are
indicated in the tables by <code>@</code> for an optional count, and <code>~</code> for
a direction.  If a particular command requires additional keystrokes, then they will be prompted for.

<p>Certain commands may be entered at any time input is accepted.
The special character CTRL+R, entered as a single keystroke,
will always refresh the screen.  This may be used at any prompt
for input, and is otherwise ignored.
</p>
<p>When playing on a UNIX or similar system, then there are
some additional special characters used by <em>moria</em>.  The special
character CTRL+C will interrupt <em>moria</em>, and asks the player if 
they really want the character to die and quit the game.  Should the player choose for the character not to die, <em>moria</em>
merely continues as before, except that resting, running,
repeated commands, etc will be terminated.  The game can be suspended
with CTRL+Z, and return to the original command shell.
In this case, <em>moria</em> is not terminated, and may be restarted at
any time from the shell.  Alternatively, the special command <code>!</code>
is available to run any normal shell command.  When it is complete, 
<em>moria</em> will restart.
</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE
will abort the command.  For the &quot;<tt>-more-</tt>&quot; message prompts, any of
SPACE, ESCAPE, RETURN (CTRL+Shift+M), or LINEFEED (CTRL+J) can be
used to continue after pausing to read the displayed message.
</p>
<p>It is possible to give control character commands in two keystrokes, 
by pressing a <code>^</code> followed by the appropriate letter of the
alphabet.  This is useful when running <em>moria</em> in circumstances
where control characters are intercepted by some external process, 
or by the operating system.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Direction"></a>
<a name="Direction-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">6.2 Direction</h3>
<p>For the original style command set, a direction is given by a
digit which is in the appropriate orientation on the keypad.
For the rogue-like command set, a direction is given by one of
the letters <code>hykulnjb</code>.  Again, the relative position of the keys
on the keyboard gives a clue as to the direction.  The digit <code>5</code>
for the original commands, and the period <code>.</code> for rogue-like commands, 
is a null direction indicator.  This means to stay in one place, or when in a look command to look in all directions.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><pre class="verbatim"> Original Directions

</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Movement is accomplished by specifying a direction immediately.
Simply press the appropriate key and the character will move one
step in that direction.  The character can only move onto and through floor
spots, and only if they contain no creatures or obstructing
objects such as a closed door.
</p>
<p>Other commands that require a direction will prompt for it.
</p>
<p>Moving the character one step at a time can be time consuming
and boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  For the original 
VMS-style command set, by using the Run command <code>.</code>, the character 
may move in a direction until something interesting happens.  For
instance, by pressing the period key <code>.</code> followed by the direction 
8, the character would continue to move up the screen, only
coming to a stop after at least one condition is satisfied.  For
the rogue-like command set, typing a shifted directional letter
will move the character in that direction until something interesting happens.  
The stopping conditions are described more completely in
the run command description below.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Command-Counts"></a>
<a name="Command-Counts-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">6.3 Command Counts</h3>

<p>Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding 
them with a count.  Counted commands will execute until the
count expires, or until any key is pressed, or until something 
significant happens, such as being attacked.  Thus, a
counted command doesn&rsquo;t work to attack another creature.  While
the command is being repeated, the number of times left to be
repeated will flash by on the command line at the bottom of the
screen.
</p>
<p>To give a count to a command in the rogue-like mode, type the
number in digits, then the command.  A count of zero defaults to
a count of 99.
</p>
<p>To give a count to a command in the original mode, press <code>#</code>,
followed by the digits.  To count a movement command (which is
itself a digit), type a space after the number, and then give the command.
</p>
<p>Counted commands are very useful for searching or tunneling, as
they automatically terminate on success, or if the character is attacked.
A counted command or a Run can be terminated a counted command by pressing
any key.  This character is ignored, but it is
safest to use a SPACE or ESCAPE which are always ignored as commands.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Selection-of-objects"></a>
<h4 class="node-heading">Selection of objects</h4>
<p>Many commands will also prompt for a particular object to be
used.  For example, the command to read a scroll will ask
which of the scrolls that the character is carrying is to be read.
In such cases, the selection is made by pressing a key for that letter of the
alphabet; when selecting from the backpack, the player may also type
a digit to select the item whose inscription is that digit.  The
prompt will indicate the possible letters, and will also allow
the <code>*</code> key to be pressed, which causes all of the available
options to be described (e.g. it lists all of the scrolls that can be read).
</p>
<p>The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower
case letter.  If lower case or a digit is used, the selection
takes place immediately.  If upper case is used, then the particular 
option is described, and you are given the option of confirming or 
retracting that choice.  Upper case selection is thus
safer, but requires an extra keystroke.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Command-descriptions"></a>
<a name="Command-descriptions-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">6.4 Command descriptions</h3>
<p>In the following command descriptions, the original style key is
given.  If the rogue-like key for that command is different, then
it will be shown following the original key.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>B &lt;Dir&gt; (f &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Bash.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
bashing an opponent.  The bashing ability increases with
weight and strength.  In addition, when bashing an opponent,
it will either perform a body bash, or, when wielding a
shield, perform a shield bash which is more effective.
</p>
<p>Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this will not
generally be a problem.  Doors that have been jammed closed
with spikes can only be opened by bashing.  Locked doors may
also be bashed open.  Bashing a door open will permanently
break it.
</p>
<p>Bashing a creature affects both the character and the opponent.
Depending on dexterity, the character may or may not be thrown
off-balance allowing free moves to the opponent.  If the
bash is successful, the opponent may be thrown off-balance,
thus giving the character some free hits or a chance to flee.  Huge
creatures such as ancient dragons will be difficult or
even impossible to bash successfully.
</p>
<p>A character automatically performs a shield bash instead of a
body bash, when they are currently wearing a shield.  A shield
bash adds the damage of a shield to that of the bash, so it
is more effective.  Size and material both affect the damage
that a shield will do.
</p>
<p>Bashing can be done with a command-count, but if the character is 
town off-balance, the count will be reset straight away.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>C</code></dt>
<dt><code>Display character (on screen or saving to a file.)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command allows the player to either display the character 
details on the terminal screen, or to save an entire character
info listing to a file.  The character&rsquo;s history, equipment,
and inventory list are also included when saving to a file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>D &lt;Dir&gt;</code></dt>
<dt><code>Disarm a trap.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The character can attempt to disarm floor traps, or trapped chests.
When the character tries and fails to disarm a trap, there is a chance that 
the blunder will set it off.  Traps on chests can only be disarmed after 
firstly finding the trap with the search command.  This command 
can have a count.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>E</code></dt>
<dt><code>Eat some food.</code></dt>
<dd><p>A character must eat occasionally to remain effective.  As a
character grows hungry, a message will appear at the bottom
of the screen saying &quot;<tt>Hungry</tt>&quot;.  When a character remains
hungry for too long, they will become weak, and eventually start
fainting, and finally die of starvation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>F</code></dt>
<dt><code>Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.</code></dt>
<dd><p>When the character is using a lamp for a light source, and
has a flask of oil in the pack, they may refill the
lamp by using this command.  A lamp is capable of a maximum
of 15000 turns of light, and each flask has 7500 turns of
oil contained in it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>G</code></dt>
<dt><code>Gain new spells.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command causes the character to learn new spells.
When the character is able to learn some spells, the word &quot;<tt>Study</tt>&quot;
appears on the status line at the bottom of the screen.
Mages, rogues, and rangers must have the magic books containing 
new spells to be able to learn them.  Priests and
Paladins are given their prayers by their gods, and hence do
not need a holy book before learning the prayers in it.
They do need the book in order to use the prayers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>L (W)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Location on map.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The location command allows the player to look at all parts of the
current dungeon level.  The displayed view of the dungeon is
shifted to bring the character&rsquo;s current position as close to the
center as possible.  The map can then be shifted using
any of the eight possible directions.  Each shift moves the
view point by one half screen.  The top line displays a map
section number, each map section having a height and width
one half that of the display, and indicates the direction of
the display from the character&rsquo;s current position.  When this command is exited and the character is not on the display, then the display
is centered again.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>M</code></dt>
<dt><code>Map shown reduced size.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command will show the entire map, reduced by a factor
of nine, on the screen.  Since nine places map into every
character on the screen, only the major dungeon features
will be visible.  This is especially useful for finding
where the stairs are in relation to the character&rsquo;s current position.
It is also useful for identifying unexplored areas.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>R</code></dt>
<dt><code>Rest for a number of turns.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The character may rest one turn with the null movement command.  Resting 
for longer periods of time is accomplished by using the
Rest command, followed by the number of turns to rest.
Resting will continue until the specified 
duration has expired, or something to wake the character happens, 
such as a creature wandering by, or getting
hungry, or some disability like blindness expiring.  It is
sometimes a good idea to rest a beat-up character until they
regain some of their hit-points, but be sure to have plenty
of food if you rest often.
</p>
<p>The character can be awakened by pressing any key.  Space is best,
since if the rest ends just before the character is typed,
the space is ignored as a command.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to rest by typing the count first, and
using either the Rest or the null movement command.
</p>
<p>When <code>*</code> is given for the rest count, the character will rest
until both hit-points and mana reach their maximum values.  As
above, the character will immediately be awakened if anything
interesting happens.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>S (#)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Search mode toggle.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Searching toggle will take the character into and out of search
mode.  When first pressed, the message &quot;<tt>Searching</tt>&quot; will
appear on the status line at the bottom of the screen.  The character is 
now taking two turns for each command, one for the command and one turn to
search.  This means that the character is taking twice the time to
move about the dungeon, and therefore twice the food.  If a
creature should happen by or attack, search mode will
automatically toggled off.  Search mode can also be turned off by again pressing the <code>S</code> (or <code>#</code>) key.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>T &lt;Dir&gt; (CTRL+&lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Tunnel through rock.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Tunneling (Mining) is a very useful art in the dungeons of <em>moria</em>.
There are four kinds of rock: 
</p><ol>
<li> Permanent Rock
</li><li> Granite Rock
</li><li> Magma Intrusion
</li><li> Quartz Veins
</li></ol>
<p>Permanent Rock is exactly 
that, permanent.  Granite is very hard, therefore hard to dig 
through, and contains no valuable metals.  Magma and Quartz 
veins are softer and sometimes bear valuable metals and gems, 
shown as a <code>$</code> or a <code>*</code> symbol.  When the character can&rsquo;t
move over these symbols, it means they are embedded in the rock, and 
the tunnel command must be used to dig them out.  There is a
game option which causes magma and quartz to be displayed differently 
than other rock types.
</p>
<p>Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when digging be
sure to wield either a shovel or a pick.  Magical shovels
and picks can be found which allow the wielder to dig much
faster than normal, and a good strength also helps.
</p>
<p>Tunneling can have a count.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>V</code></dt>
<dt><code>View scoreboard.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command will display the contents of the score board on
the screen.  On a multiuser system, pressing <code>V</code> the first
time will show only those scores from the score board that
belong to the current user, and pressing <code>V</code> again will show
all users&rsquo; scores.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>a &lt;Dir&gt; (z &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Aim a wand.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used.  Wands are
magical devices and therefore use the Magical Devices ability 
of the character.  They will either affect the first
object/creature encountered, or affect anything in a given
direction, depending upon the wand.  An obstruction such as
a door or wall will generally stop the effects of a wand
from traveling further.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>b (P)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Browse a book.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Books can only be read if the character is of its realm.  Therefore
a magic user could read a magic book, but not a holy book.
Warriors will not be able to read either kind of book.  When
the browse command is used, all of the spells or prayers
contained therein are displayed, along with information such
as their level, the amount of mana used up in casting them,
and whether or not you know the spell or prayer.  There are
a total of 31 different magical spells in four books, and 31
different prayers in four books.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>c &lt;Dir&gt;</code></dt>
<dt><code>Close a door.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be able
to open a door.  Therefore shutting doors can be a life
saver.  To close a door, the character must be adjacent to an open door, and 
broken doors cannot be closed.  Bashing a closed door will break it and leave it permanently open.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>d</code></dt>
<dt><code>Drop an object from the inventory.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Objects can be dropped onto the floor beneath the character if that
floor spot does not already contain an object.  Doors and
traps are considered objects in this sense.  If the character has
several objects of the same kind, the player will be prompted for
dropping one or all of them.  It is possible to directly
drop things which you are wielding or wearing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>e</code></dt>
<dt><code>Display a list of equipment being used.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the Equipment command to display a list of objects
currently being worn or wielded by the character.  Each object has a
specific place where it is placed, and that only one object
of each type may be used at any one time, excepting rings of
which two can be worn, one on each hand.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>f &lt;Dir&gt; (t &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Fire/Throw an object/use a missile weapon.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Any object carried by the character can be thrown.  Depending 
upon the weight of an object, it may travel across a
room or drop down beside the character.  When a stackable object 
like an arrow is thrown, only one will be thrown at a time.
</p>
<p>When throwing at a creature, the chance of hitting the
creature is determined by the character&rsquo;s pluses to hit, the 
ability at throwing, and the object&rsquo;s pluses to hit.  Once the
creature is hit, the object may or may not do any actual
damage to it.  Certain objects in the dungeon can do great
amounts of damage when thrown, but it&rsquo;s for the player to figure
out the obscure ones.  Oil flasks are considered to be lit
before thrown; therefore, they will do fire damage to a
creature if they hit it.
</p>
<p>To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
arrows.  Extra pluses to damage and hitting are gained by
wielding the proper weapon and throwing the corresponding
ammo.  A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a
killer...
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>i</code></dt>
<dt><code>Display a list of objects being carried.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command displays an inventory of all objects being carried,
but not currently in use (e.g. being worn or wielded).  The character may 
carry up to 22 different kinds of objects in the pack.  Depending upon 
strength, the character will be able carry many identical objects before 
hitting the weight limit.  After the weight limit is exceeded the character 
will move slower due to the encumbrance.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>j &lt;Dir&gt; (S &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Jam a door with an iron spike.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
a closed door, and can eventually get through a locked door.
Therefore the character may also spike a door in order to jam it.  Each
spike used on a door will increase its strength, although
as more spikes are jammed, the less effect each additional
spike has.  It is very easy to jam a door so much as to make
it impossible for the character to bash it down, so spike
doors wisely.  The bigger a creature is, the easier it can
bash a door down.  Therefore twenty or more spikes might be
necessary to slow down a dragon, where one spike would slow
down a kobold.  This command can be counted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>l &lt;Dir&gt; (x &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Look in a direction.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type of
object or creature shown on the screen.  Also, if a creature
is on top of an object, the look command will describe both.
Creatures and objects can be seen up to 200 feet away (20
spaces or tiles).  The Look command can be used freely without the
creatures getting a turn to move against the character.
</p>
<p>Looking in a particular direction sees everything within a
cone of vision which just overlaps the cones of the two
adjacent directions.  Looking with the null direction <code>5</code>
(or <code>.</code>) sees everything which there is to be seen.
</p>
<p>The character is able to access monster memories with this
command.  When the character sees a creature, the player has the option
to view a short paragraph of information about prior
experiences with that creature.  See also the section on
being attacked.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m</code></dt>
<dt><code>Cast a magic spell.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To cast a spell, a character must have previously learned
it, and must also have in the inventory a magical book from
which the spell may be read.  Each spell has a chance of
failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as a
character gains levels.  If a character does not have enough
mana, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and
gambles on losing a point of constitution.  The player will be
prompted for confirmation before trying to cast a spell when
there is insufficient mana.  Since a character must read the
spell from a book, they cannot be blind or confused when casting 
a spell, and there must be some light present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o &lt;Dir&gt;</code></dt>
<dt><code>Open a door, chest, or lock.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To open an object such as a door or chest, the
Open command can be used.  If the object is locked, the Open command
will attempt to pick the lock, based on the character&rsquo;s disarm ability.
If an object is trapped and the character opens it, the
trap will be set off.  This command can be counted, because
the locked object may require several tries to open.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>p</code></dt>
<dt><code>Read a prayer.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To pray effectively, a character must have learned the
prayer, and must also have in the inventory a holy book from
which the prayer may be read.  Each prayer has a chance of
being ignored which starts out fairly large but decreases as
a character gains levels.  If a character does not have
enough mana, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and
gambles on losing a point of constitution.  The player will be
prompted for confirmation before trying to pray when there is 
insufficient mana.  Since a character must read the
prayer from a book, they cannot be blind or confused when
praying, and there must be some light present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>q</code></dt>
<dt><code>Quaff a potion.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A potion affects
the character in some manner.  The effects of the potion may be
immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dt><code>Read a scroll.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To read a scroll use the Read command.  Most scroll spells
either affect the player or the area around the character; a
few cases such as identify scrolls act on other objects.
Two scrolls, the identify scroll and the recharge scroll,
have titles which can be read without setting them off, and
by pressing ESCAPE can be saved for future use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>s</code></dt>
<dt><code>Search general area one turn.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Search command can be used to locate hidden traps and
secret doors about the character.  More than a single turn of
searching will be required in most cases.  The character should always
search a chest before trying to open it because they are
generally trapped.  This command can be counted, and the counted 
search ends as soon as anything is found.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>t (T)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Take off a piece of equipment.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the Take Off command to remove an object from use, and
return it to the character&rsquo;s pack, or inventory.  Occasionally the 
character will have a cursed item which cannot be removed.  Cursed
items are always bad, and can only be taken off after removing the
curse.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>u (Z)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Use/Zap a staff.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Use command will activate a staff.  Like scrolls, most
staves have an area effect.  Because staves are generally
more powerful than most other items, they are also harder to
use correctly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>v</code></dt>
<dt><code>Display current version of game.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Version command displays the credits for the current
version of <em>moria</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>w</code></dt>
<dt><code>Wear or wield an item being carried.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To wear or wield an object in the character&rsquo;s inventory, use the
Wear/Wield command.  If another object is already in use for
the same function, it is automatically removed first; if the character
is wearing two rings, the player is given a choice of which one
to remove.  An object&rsquo;s bonuses cannot be gained until it is
worn or wielded.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x (X)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Exchange primary and secondary weapons.</code></dt>
<dd><p>A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed often.
Instead of searching through the inventory, the character may use the
exchange command to keep the weapon ready (e.g. slung over the 
character&rsquo;s back).  For instance, if the bow was going to be used primarily, 
but needed a sword for close combat, the character could wield the sword, 
use the exchange command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield
the bow.  If the sword was suddenly needed, simply use the
exchange command to switch between the bow and the sword.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>/</code></dt>
<dt><code>Identify a character shown on screen.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the identify command to find out what a symbol
displayed on the screen stands for.  For instance, by pressing 
<code>/.</code>, the player can find out that the <code>.</code> stands for a floor
spot, or tile.  When used with a creature, the identify command will
only tell what class of creature the symbol stands for,
not the specific creature; therefore, use the look command
for this information.
</p>
<p>When identifying a symbol for a creature in the character&rsquo;s monster
memory, the player has the option to view 
a paragraph of information on those creatures identified by
the given character.  Several creatures may be identified in
this way.  Typing ESCAPE after the paragraph for any
creature will abort back to command level.  See also the
section on being attacked.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>?</code></dt>
<dt><code>Display a list of commands.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>?</code> command displays a quick reference help page on the
screen.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-</code></dt>
<dt><code>Move without pickup.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is followed by a move command, and causes the character to move
over an object without automatically picking it up.  This command can be counted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>=</code></dt>
<dt><code>Set options.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a free move, to set various game options in <em>moria</em>.  The
available options are:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Cut known corners when running.  This is on by default, and
the only reason for switching it off would be if the character had the
search mode on and wished to look for secret doors in the extremity
of every corner.

</li><li> Examine potential corners when running.  This is on by
default, and allows the character to run along an unknown curving corridor.  
If however, the character is running from a creature, the player
may wish to switch this option off, because the creature
will cut the corner.

</li><li> Display self during a run.  This is off by default, which
gives faster screen updating.

</li><li> Stop when map sector changes.  This is off by default, but
can be switched on to stop running whenever a
new part of the dungeon appears in view.

</li><li> Treat open doors as empty space while running.  This is off
by default, in which case the character stops whenever they run up to an
open door.

</li><li> Prompt to pick up objects.  This is off by default, in which
case stepping over an object automatically causes the character to
pick it up.  With the option on, the player gets prompted in all
such cases with a description of the object to see if it should be put
into the character&rsquo;s pack.

</li><li> Rogue-like command set.  This option controls the command
set in use.  It is off by default.

</li><li> Show weights in inventory.  This is off by default: switching 
it on causes the inventory and equipment listings to
include the weight of all objects.  This may be useful to
know if the character&rsquo;s pack is getting too heavy.

</li><li> Highlight and notice mineral seams.  This is off by default.
Switching it on causes quartz and magma to be displayed as
<code>%</code> instead of <code>#</code>; also, it causes the look command to
treat them as interesting objects.  This is handy when mining.  
Setting this option does not immediately highlight all
minerals, but only those which are subsequently displayed.
To display all minerals, just move the map around a bit with
the <em>Where</em> (or <em>Locate</em>) command.

</li><li> Beep for invalid character.  This is on by default.  When
this option is on, the program will beep for most invalid characters, such
as trying to choose a spell that hasn&rsquo;t been learned yet.
When off, there are no such beeps.

</li><li> Display rest/repeat counts.  This is on by default.  When
on, the program will progressively display the remaining
turns left while resting, and for repeated commands.  For
those trying to play over a very slow connection, or
for those playing on very slow computers, turning this
off will make resting and repeated commands work much faster.

</li><li> Disable haggling.  This is off by default.  When on, all
haggling will be disabled at the cost of a 10 percent tax
on the final price on items you would otherwise have had to
haggle for, and all prices displayed in the stores will be
the actual prices you have to pay.
</li></ol>

<p>The setting of all these options persist in the savefile,
even after the character dies.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>^P</code></dt>
<dt><code>Previous message.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Control-P command will redisplay the last message
displayed on the message line at the top of the screen.  A
second such command will display all of the saved messages.
This command can be given a count to specify the number
of previous messages to display.  At present, only 22 messages 
are saved.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>^K (^Q)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Kill the character.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To exit the game without saving the character (i.e. killing
the character) use the Control-K command.  Once exited in this
manner, the character is nonrecoverable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>^X</code></dt>
<dt><code>Save the character and exit the game.</code></dt>
<dd><p>To save the game so that it can be restarted later, use the
Control-X command.  Save files will also be generated if the
game crashes due to a system error.  When the character dies, a reduced
savefile is produced containing only the monster memory,
and the option settings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>{</code></dt>
<dt><code>Inscribe an object.</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command can be used to inscribe any short string on an
object.  Inscriptions are limited to twelve characters.  The
inscription applies only to the particular object, it is not
automatically transferred to all similar objects.  Under
certain circumstances, <em>moria</em> will itself inscribe objects:
if they have been discovered to be cursed or enchanted, or
if they have been sampled without being identified.  In this
last case, <em>moria</em> does in fact carefully inscribe every such
item.
</p>
<p>If the inscription on an item is a single digit, that digit
can be used to refer to it when using, wearing, or wielding
an item from inside the pack.  For example, if a shovel is kept in
the pack with the inscription <code>1</code>, you can switch to the shovel
by wielding item <code>1</code> without checking the full inventory list
to find out which item the shovel is.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>!</code></dt>
<dt><code>Shell out of game.</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the Shell command <code>!</code> to temporarily exit the game to
execute UNIX or DOS commands.  The game can be reentered by
typing exit to end the spawned process.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&lt;</code></dt>
<dt><code>Go up an up staircase.</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the character moves onto an up staircase the <code>&lt;</code> command
will take the character to go up one level (e.g. one level of dungeon depth).
There is always one staircase going up on every level except for 
the town level (this does not mean it&rsquo;s easy to find).  Going up a 
staircase will always take the character
to a new dungeon area except for the town level, which
remains the same for the duration of the current character&rsquo;s game.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&gt;</code></dt>
<dt><code>Go down a down staircase.</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the character is on top of a down staircase the <code>&gt;</code>
command may be used to go down one level of dungeon depth.  There are 
always two or three
staircases going down on each level, except the town level
which has only one.  Going down will always take the character to a
new dungeon area.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>. &lt;Dir&gt; (shift &lt;Dir&gt;)</code></dt>
<dt><code>Move in direction.</code></dt>
<dd><p>The Run command will move the character in the indicated direction
until either a choice needs to be made between two directions, 
or something interesting happens.  There are options
which determine behavior at corners, and at screen boundaries.  
More precisely, the conditions which stop a run are
as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> A creature appears on the screen, one already on the screen
moves, or a creature attacks or casts a spell at the character.

</li><li> The character moves next to an object, or a feature such as a door or
trap.

</li><li> The character comes to the end of open space, or the end of a passage,
or a junction of passages, or a hole in a wall.

</li><li> Anything typed during a run causes the run to stop.  The
keyboard key causing this to occur is ignored.  It is best to
use a space, which is ignored as a command, just in case the
run stops just before the key is pressed.

</li><li> Various changes of state, such as recovery from fear or loss
of heroism, will stop a run.
</li></ol>

<p>Corners are more complex.  A corner allows a choice between
adjacent rectangular and diagonal directions.  If the character can
see walls which ensure that the diagonal gives a faster
traversal, then action is determined by the &quot;cut corners&quot;
options.  If it is set, then the character moves diagonally through the
corner.  This gives maximum speed (as is nice when
fleeing a hidden creature).  On the other hand, this option
should not be set if more careful coverage is desired (as when
searching) so that the character take two moves through the
corner.
</p>
<p>At a potential corner, where walls are not yet visible ahead
of the rectangular direction, the &quot;examine corners&quot; option
is considered.  If set, the character will move straight into the
corner, which will light up all the corner and so determine
where to go from there.  This allows the character to follow
corners in new passages.  If the option is not set, the character
stops.  This allows highly cautious running where the character
stops at all potential choice points.
</p>
<p>If the character moves off the screen while running, then a new section
of the dungeon is displayed and the run continues.  However,
if the &quot;stop when map changes&quot; option is set, the character will stop.
Again, this is an option for nervous players; after all,
there may be a dragon on the new screen, and running into a dragon can 
be bad for the character&rsquo;s health.

<a name="The-Town-Level"></a>
<a name="The-Town-Level-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">7 The Town Level</h2>
<p>The town level is where the character will begin the adventure.  The town
consists of six buildings, each with an entrance, some townspeople, 
and a wall which surrounds the town.  At the start of the game it will be
daytime in the town, but later on the character may return to find that darkness 
has fallen.  (Note that some spells may act differently in
the town level.)
</p>


<hr>
<a name="Townspeople"></a>
<a name="Townspeople-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.1 Townspeople</h3>
<p>The town contains many different kinds of people.  There are the
street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for
money, and seem to come out of the woodwork when excited.
Blubbering Idiots are a constant annoyance, but not harmful.
Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no threat
to anyone.  Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a likely victim
to mug.  And finally, what town would be complete without a swarm
of half-drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just
for the fun of it.
</p>
<p>Most of the townspeople should be avoided by the largest possible
distance when wandering from store to store.  Fights will break
out though, so be prepared.  Since the character grew up in this
world of intrigue, no experience is awarded for killing on the
town level.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Supplies"></a>
<a name="Supplies-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.2 Supplies</h3>
<p>The character will begin the adventure with some supplies
already in the backpack.  Use the Inventory <code>i</code> command to check what
these supplies are.  It will be necessary to buy other supplies
before continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter
each of the stores.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Town-Buildings"></a>
<a name="Town-Buildings-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.3 Town Buildings</h3>
<p>The character may enter any of the stores, if they are open, and barter
with the owner for items that can be afforded.  When bartering, the player
enters prices you will pay (or accept) for some object.  An absolute amount
can be entered, or an amount preceded with a plus
or minus sign to give a positive or negative increment on the
previous offer.  When an increment has been previously given, pressing RETURN
will use the previous increment.  But be warned that
the owners can easily be insulted, and may even throw the character out for
a while if you insult them too often.  To enter a store, simply
move onto the entrance represented by the numbers <code>1</code> through <code>6</code>.
</p>
<p>If the character consistently bargains well in a store, that is, you reach
the final offer much more often than not, then the store owner
will eventually recognize that the character is a superb haggler, and will
go directly to the final offer instead of haggling with you.
Items which cost less than 10 gold pieces do not count, as haggling 
well with these items is usually either very easy or almost
impossible.
</p>
<p>Once inside a store, the store inventory will appear on the
screen along with a set of options for the character.  The store&rsquo;s inventory
can be browsed if there is more than one page to display.  Items can be sold to, or purchased from the character&rsquo;s backpack.
Regular inventory and equipment commands can be executed in a store.
Although the wear, take off, and exchange commands do not appear in the options, they will still work, but
were excluded to keep the options simple.
</p>
<p>Stores do not always have everything in stock.  As the game
progresses, they may get new items, so check from time to time.
Also, if you sell them an item, it may get sold to a customer
while you are adventuring, so don&rsquo;t always expect to be able to
get back everything you have sold.
</p>
<p>Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items.  If an object
is unidentified, they will pay some base price for it.  Once
they have bought it they will immediately identify the object.
If it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory.  If
it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item away.  In any
case, the player may receive some knowledge of the item if another is
encountered.

<a name="Within-The-Dungeon"></a>
<a name="Within-The-Dungeon-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">8 Within The Dungeon</h2>
<p>Once the character is adequately supplied with food, light,
armor, and weapons, it is time to enter the dungeon.  Move on
top of the <code>&gt;</code> symbol and use the down <code>&gt;</code> command.  The character 
enters a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
passes through a one-way door.  The character is now on the first level of
the dungeon (50 feet), and must survive many horrible and challenging 
encounters to find the treasure lying about.
</p>
<p>There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon: permanent 
light which has been magically placed within rooms, and a
light source carried by the character.  If neither is present, the
character will be unable to map or see any attackers.  Lack of
light will also affect searching, picking locks, disarming, and casting spells.
</p>
<p>A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply their own
light.  Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turns left
before burning out, the message &quot;<tt>Your light is growing faint</tt>&quot;
will be displayed at random intervals.  Once a torch is burnt
out, it is useless and can be dropped.  A lamp or lantern can be
refilled with oil by using the Fill <code>F</code> command, however the character must
be carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Attacking-and-Being-Attacked"></a>
<a name="Attacking-and-Being-Attacked-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">9 Attacking and Being Attacked</h2>
<p>Attacking is simple in <em>moria</em>.  When moving into a creature, 
the character attacks it.  The character can attack from a distance by firing a missile,
or by magical means such as aiming a wand.  Creatures attack in
the same way; if they move into the character, they attack.  Some
creatures can also cast spells from a distance, and others can
breathe fire or worse from a distance.
</p>

<p>Creatures moving in walls cannot be attacked by wands and other
magic attacks normally stopped by walls.  The character can attack a
creature in a wall normally though by trying to move into the
wall space containing the creature.  However, in order to attack
an invisible creature in a wall, the character must tunnel into the wall
containing the creature.  Trying to move into the wall will bump the 
character&rsquo;s head, and they will look quite silly.
</p>
<p>If the character is wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is used
when a creature is hit.  Otherwise, the character gets two fist strikes.
Very strong creatures can do a lot of damage with their fists...
The character may have a primary weapon, and a secondary weapon which is
kept on the belt or shoulder for immediate use.  Weapons can be switched 
with the exchange command.  
Be sure to wield the proper weapon when fighting.  Hitting
a dragon over the head with a bow will simply make it mad, and
get the character killed.
</p>
<p>Missile weapons, such as bows, can be wielded, and then the
proper missile, in this case an arrow, can be fired across the
room into a target.  Missiles can be used without the proper missile 
weapon, but used together they have a greater range and do
far more damage.
</p>
<p>Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit versus armor
class.  A hit is a strike that does some damage; a miss may in
fact reach a target, but fails to do any damage.  Higher armor
classes make it harder to do damage, and so lead to more misses.
</p>
<p>In <em>Moria</em>, your character can wear any armor or wield any weapon &ndash; it is not limited by race or class.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="Monster-Memories"></a>
<a name="Monster-Memories-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.1 Monster Memories</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of different creatures in the mines of <em>moria</em>,
many of which look the same on the screen.  The exact species of
a creature can be discovered by looking at it.  It is also very
difficult to keep track of the capabilities of various creatures.
Rather than forcing the player to keep notes, <em>moria</em> automatically keeps
track of prior experiences with a particular creature.  This is
called the <em>monster memory</em>.  The monster memory recalls the particular 
attacks of each creature which the character has suffered, as well
as recalling if the character has observed them to multiply or move erratically, 
or drop treasure, or many other attributes.
</p>
<p>If the character has killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered
enough attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide 
information not otherwise available, such as a armor class
or hit dice.  These are not explained, but may be useful to give
the relative danger of each creature.  This memory can be passed
on to a new character even after the character dies, by means of a reduced
savefile.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="The-Character_0027s-Weapon"></a>
<a name="The-Character_0027s-Weapon-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.2 The Character&rsquo;s Weapon</h3>
<p>Carrying a weapon in a backpack doesn&rsquo;t do much good.  The character must
wield a weapon before it can be used in a fight.  A secondary
weapon can be kept by wielding it and then using the exchange
command.  A secondary weapon is not in use, simply ready to be
switched with the current weapon if needed.
</p>
<p>Weapons have two main characteristics, their ability to hit and
their ability to do damage, expressed as <code>(+#,+#)</code>.  A normal
weapon would be <code>(+0,+0)</code>.  Many weapons in <em>moria</em> have magical
bonuses to hit and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, and
have penalties that hurt the character.  Cursed weapons cannot be
taken off until the curse is lifted.
</p>
<p><em>Moria</em> assumes that the youth of the character spent in the rough environment near the dungeons has taught the relative merits of different weapons,
and displays as part of their description the damage dice which
define their capabilities.  The ability to damage is added to the
dice roll for that weapon.  The dice used for a given weapon is
displayed as <code>#d#</code>.  The first number indicates how many dice to
roll, and the second indicates how many sides they have.  A <code>2d6</code>
weapon will give damage from 2 to 12, plus any damage bonus.  The
weight of a weapon is also a consideration.  Heavy weapons may
hit harder, but they are also harder to use.  Depending on the
strength stat and the weight of the weapon, the character may get several hits
in a single turn.
</p>
<p>Missile booster weapons, such as bows, have their characteristics
added to those of the missile used, if the proper weapon/missile
combination is used.  Also, these weapons will multiply the base
damage of the missile by a number from 2 to 4, depending on the
strength of the weapon.  This multiplier is displayed as <code>(x#)</code>.
</p>
<p>Although the character receives any magical bonuses an unidentified weapon
may possess when you wield it, those bonuses will not be added in
to the displayed values of to-hit and to-dam on the character
sheet.  Weapons must be identified before the displayed values
reflect the real values used.
</p>
<p>Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  These are
called ego weapons, and are feared by great and meek.  An ego
sword must be wielded to receive benefit of its abilities.
</p>
<p>Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>DF</code></dt>
<dt><code>Defender.</code></dt>
<dd><p>A magical weapon that helps wielders defend themselves, thus
increasing their armor class, and protecting them
against damage from fire, frost, acid, lightning, and falls.
This weapon also will increase stealth, let the character see
invisible creatures, protect from paralyzation attacks,
and help regenerate hit-points and mana faster.  As a
result of the regeneration ability, the character will use up food
faster than normal while wielding such a weapon.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>FB</code></dt>
<dt><code>Frost Brand.</code></dt>

<a name="Body-and-Shield-Bashes-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.3 Body and Shield Bashes</h3>
<p>Weight is the primary factor in being able to bash something, but
strength plays a role too.  After bashing, a character may be off-balance 
for several rounds depending upon the dexterity stat.
</p>
<p>Doors can be broken down by bashing them.  Once a door is bashed
open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.
</p>
<p>Chests too may be bashed open, but be warned that the careless
smashing of a chest often ruins the contents.  Bashing open a
chest will not disarm any traps it may contain, but does allow
the strong and ignorant to see what is inside.
</p>
<p>Finally, a creature may be bashed.  If a shield is currently
being worn, the bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.
In either case, a bash may throw an opponent off-balance for a
number of rounds, allowing the character to get in a free hit or more.
If the character is thrown off-balance, the opponent may get free
hits.  This is a risky attack.

<a name="The-Character_0027s-Armor-Class"></a>
<a name="The-Character_0027s-Armor-Class-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">9.4 The Character&rsquo;s Armor Class</h3>
<p>Armor class is a number that describes the amount and the quality
of armor being worn.  Armor class will generally run from about 0
to 60, but could become negative or greater than 60 in rare
cases.
</p>
<p>The larger the armor class, the more protective it is.  A negative 
armor class would actually help the character get hit.  Armor protects
in three manners.  One, it makes the character harder to be hit for
damage.  A hit for no damage is the same as a miss.  Two, good
armor will absorb some of the damage that the character would
have taken.  An armor class of 30 absorbs 15% of damage.
Three, acid damage is reduced by wearing body
armor.  It is obvious that a high armor class is a must for surviving 
the lower levels of <em>moria</em>.
</p>
<p>Each piece of armor has an armor class adjustment, and a magical
bonus.  Armor bought in town will have these values displayed
with its description.  Armor that is found within the dungeon
must be identified before these values will be displayed.  All
armor always has the base armor class displayed, to which the
bonus is added.  It is always possible to figure this out anyway,
by watching the effect it has on the displayed armor class.
</p>
<p>Armor class values are always displayed between a set of brackets
as <code>[#]</code> or <code>[#,+#]</code>.  The first value is the armor class of the
item.  The second number is the magical bonus of the item which
is only displayed if known, and will always have a sign preceding
the value.  There are a few cases where the form <code>[+#]</code> is used,
meaning the object has no armor class, only a magical armor bonus
if worn.  Body armor may also have a (-#) displayed in
parentheses; this is a penalty to hit, because the bulk of the
armor makes it more difficult to swing a weapon freely.
</p>
<p>Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities denoted by
the following abbreviations:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>RA</code></dt>
<dt><code>Resist Acid.</code></dt>
<dd><p>A character using such an object will take only one-third

damaged by it.

<h3 class="section">9.6 Magic Spells</h3>

<p>All characters except warriors are able to learn some form of
magic spells.  There are two kinds of magic in the game:
</p><ol>
<li> Magic Spells
</li><li> Prayers
</li></ol>
<p>Magic spells can be casted by mages, rogues, and rangers.
Prayers can be prayed by priests and paladins.
Each spell/prayer has a minimum level required for learning it, a mana score,
which is the mana points required to cast it, and a failure percentage.
</p>
<p>Mana points are determined by the character&rsquo;s experience level, and the level of
a key stat.  For mages, rogues, and rangers, the key stat is intelligence,
for priests and paladins the key stat is wisdom.  The effect of the key
stat is shown by the following table.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="verbatim">             Stat Level                 Factor
                3-7                       0
                8-17                      1
               18-18/49                  3/2
            18/50-18/69                   2
            18/70-18/89                  5/2
            18/90-18/99                   3
               18/100                     4
</pre></div>

<p>The mana score is the factor times the experience level plus 1.
If the key stat is 7 or less, the mana score will be zero (not one)
and the character will not be able to use any spells.  When attempting to cast a spell that calls for more mana than the character has, the rate of failure is much
greater than normal.  The character will faint for a few turns afterward, and there is a chance at damaging health too.
</p>

<a name="Priest-Spells"></a>
<a name="Priest-Spells-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">9.6.1 Priest Spells</h4>

<p>Priest spells are received from the character&rsquo;s deity.  When the <code>G</code>
command is issued to learn new spells, spells are chosen randomly from
the spells that the character is able to cast.  The character need not
have the book the spell is in to learn it, because the god gave it to the character,
but the book is needed to cast the spell.  Failure percentages and spell
effectiveness are based on wisdom for priests and paladins.

<h4 class="subsection">9.6.2 Mage Spells</h4>

<p>Mage Spells are more powerful and offensive in nature than priest
spells.  This offsets the fact that magicians are generally weaker
than any other class.  Because mage spells are learned though
study, the correct magic book must be present in the character&rsquo;s pack to learn and cast a
spell.  Learning spells can be banked up.  For example:  a
second level mage who had learned Magic Missile and can learn one
more spell.  If the mage does not wish to learn Detect Monsters, Phase Door
or Light Area, the mage can wait until the third level and learn
both the Cure Light Wounds and Stinking Cloud, both third level
spells.  Spell failure and effectiveness is based on intelligence
for mages, rangers, and rogues.  Rangers can learn all but the most
powerful offensive spell.  Rogues cannot learn any offensive spell.

<h4 class="subsection">9.6.3 Using Offensive Spells Against Monsters</h4>

<p>Monsters have a chance to save themselves from damage caused by
offensive spells, just like the character has a chance to be saved from
damage by monster spells.  This chance is greater for higher level
monsters than for lower level monsters.  Also, some spells will never
work against monsters whose level is higher than the character&rsquo;s
experience level.
</p>
<p>Many monsters are immune to certain kinds of attack, and will suffer little
or no damage from such attacks.  For example, a fire-breathing dragon will
suffer little damage from a fire ball, but will suffer greatly from a
frost ball.  Also, undead creatures will not be affected by sleep spells,
since they never sleep.
</p>

<a name="Objects-Found-In-The-Dungeon"></a>
<a name="Objects-Found-In-The-Dungeon-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">10 Objects Found In The Dungeon</h2>
<p>The mines are full of objects just waiting to be picked up and
used.  How did they get there?  Well, the main source for useful
items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded into the
dungeon beforehand.  They get killed, and the helpful creatures
scatter the various treasure throughout the dungeon.  Most cursed
items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers, who enjoy a
good joke when it gets someone killed.
</p>
<p>The character picks up objects by moving on top of them.  Up to 22 
different items can be carried in the backpack while wearing and wielding
many others.  Although limited to 22 different items, several items of each kind can be carried, restricted only by the amount of weight the character can carry.  The weight limit
is determined by the strength stat.  Only one object may occupy a
given floor location, which may or may not also contain one
creature.  Doors, traps, and staircases are considered objects
for this purpose.
</p>
<p>When carrying more weight than the character is able, they will move
more slowly than normal until the extra weight is dropped.  If
picking up an object would take the character over their weight limit, then
the player will be asked whether or not the object should be picked up. 
It is a good idea to leave the object alone when fleeing from a
monster.
</p>
<p>Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands for
their use.  Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls
must be Read, and potions must be Quaffed.  In any case, the character must
first be able to carry an object before it can be used.  Some
objects, such as chests, are very complex.  Chests contain other
objects and may be trapped, and/or locked.  Read the list of
commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.
</p>
<p>One item in particular will be discussed here.  The scroll of
&quot;Word-of-Recall&quot; can be found within the dungeon, or bought at
the temple in town.  It acts in two manners, depending upon the character&rsquo;s
location.  If read within the dungeon, it will teleport
the character back to town.  If read in town, it will teleport the character back
down to the deepest level of the dungeon on which the character
has previously been.  This makes the scroll very useful for getting 
back to the deeper levels of <em>moria</em>.  Once the scroll has
been read, it takes a while for the spell to act, so don&rsquo;t expect
it to save the character in a crisis.
</p>
<p>The game provides some automatic inscriptions to help keep
track of possessions.  Wands and staves which are known to
be empty will be inscribed with &quot;<tt>empty</tt>&quot;.  Objects which have been
tried at least once, but haven&rsquo;t been identified yet will be
inscribed with &quot;<tt>tried</tt>&quot;.  Cursed objects are inscribed with
&quot;<tt>damned</tt>&quot;.  Also, occasionally the character will notice that something in
the pack or equipment list seems to be magical.  High level
characters are much more likely to notice this than beginning
characters.  When the character does notice this, the item in question will
be inscribed with &quot;<tt>magik</tt>&quot;.
</p>
<p>And lastly, a final warning: not all objects are what they seem.
Skeletons lying peacefully about the dungeon have been known to
get up...

<a name="Cursed-Objects-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.1 Cursed Objects</h3>
<p>Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid upon
them.  These horrible objects will look like any other normal
item, but will detract from the character&rsquo;s stats or abilities
if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove until a remove
curse is done.
</p>
<p>When a cursed item is worn or wielded, the character will immediately feel
that something has gone wrong.  The item will also be inscribed &quot;<tt>damned</tt>&quot;.
</p>

<a name="Mining"></a>
<a name="Mining-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">10.2 Mining</h3>
<p>Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by mining 
it out of the walls.  Many rich strikes exist within each
level, but must be found and mined.  Quartz veins are the
richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will
have some hordes hidden within.
</p>
<p>Mining is virtually impossible without a pick or shovel.  Picks
and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed as
<code>(+#)</code>.  The higher the number, the better the magical digging
ability of the tool.  A pick or shovel also has pluses to hit
and damage, and can be used as a weapon.
</p>
<p>When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character should
wield a pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.  When
that section is removed, another section of the vein can be located, 
and begin the process again.  Since granite rock is much
harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the vein
exactly and dig around the granite.  There is a game option for
highlighting magma and quartz.
</p>
<p>If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure location, all strikes
of treasure within a vein can be immediately
shown on the screen.  This makes mining much easier and more profitable.
</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within the
dungeon by using various magical spells and items.  So it is a
very good idea to always carry some kind of digging tool, even
when tunneling for treasure is not a goal.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Staircases, Secret Doors, Passages and Rooms</h3>
<p>Staircases are the manner in which the character gets deeper, or climbs out
of the dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircases are
the same as the commands to use them.  A <code>&lt;</code> represents an up
staircase and a <code>&gt;</code> represents a down staircase.  The character must move
on top of the staircase before they can be used.
</p>
<p>Each level has at least one up staircase, and at least two down
staircases.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  The character may have
trouble finding some well hidden secret doors, but the stairs are
there.
</p>
<p>Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and
demoralize adventurers foolish enough to enter.  But with some
luck, and lots of concentration, these secret doors can be found.
Secret doors will sometimes hide rooms or corridors, or even
entire sections of that level of the dungeon.  Sometimes they
simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.
</p>
<p>Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use these secret
doors.  If they leave one open, the character will be able to go right
through it.  If they close it behind them the character will have to search
for the catch first.  Once a secret door has been discovered,
it is drawn as a known door and no more searching will be
required to use it.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Winning The Game</h2>
<p>Once the character has progressed into killing dragons with but
a mean glance and snap of the fingers, they may be ready to take on
the Balrog.  The Balrog will appear on most levels after level
49 (a depth of 2450 feet), so don&rsquo;t go down there until the character is
ready to take on the biggest and baddest creature in the game.
</p>
<p>The Balrog cannot be killed in some of the easier methods used on
normal creatures.  The Balrog will cunningly teleport to another level 
if a spell such as destruction is cast.  Also, the Balrog cannot be 
polymorphed, slept, confused or genocided.  Magical spells like coldball 
are effective, as are weapons, but the Balrog is difficult to kill, and if
allowed to escape to another level it can heal itself.
</p>
<p>If the character should actually survive the attempt of killing the Balrog,
they will receive the status of WINNER.  Since the toughest creature 
alive has been defeated, the character is ready to retire
and cannot be saved.  When you quit the game, the character
receives a surprise bonus score.

<p>If the character falls below 0 hit-points, they have died and cannot 
be restored.  A tombstone showing information about the
character will be displayed.  A record of the character will be provided, 
along with all of the equipment (identified) either on the screen or saved in a file.
</p>
<p>The character will leave behind a reduced savefile, which contains 
only the monster memory and the game option choices.  It may be
restored, in which case the new character is generated exactly as
if the file was not there, but the new character will find the monster

<h3 class="section">15.1 The Early Days of Moria</h3>
<p>Robert Alan Koeneke, posting on <tt>rec.games.roguelike.*</tt>, 21.  February 1996
</p>
<p>I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its relation to Rogue. So I thought I would just post some text on the early days of Moria.
</p>
<p>First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first Moria. I had a lot of mail accusing me of pulling their leg and such. I just recently connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the dark ages where Internet is concerned) and was real surprised to find Moria in the news groups... Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I have never seen it. I probably spoke to its originator though... I have given permission to lots of people through the years to enhance, modify, or whatever as long as they freely distributed the results. I have always been a proponent of sharing games, not selling them.
</p>
<p>Anyway...
</p>
<p>Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University of Oklahoma. The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version of UNIX. I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get to know the system administrators. They invited me one night to stay and play some games, an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure (later just &rsquo;Adventure&rsquo;), and late one night, a new dungeon game called &rsquo;Rogue&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye. In fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play time wasted on Moria and its descendants...
</p>
<p>Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a different department as a student assistant in computers. I worked on one of the early VAX 11/780&rsquo;s running VMS, and no games were available for it at that time. The engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who thought the only purpose of a computer was WORK! Imagine... Soooo, no more games, and no more rogue!
</p>
<p>This was intolerable! So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta 1.0. I had three languages available on my VMS system. Fortran IV, PASCAL V1.?, and BASIC. Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote the first attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue, at least what I could remember of it. Then I began getting ideas of how to improve it, how it should work differently, and I pretty much didn&rsquo;t touch it for about a year.
</p>
<p>Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its recognizable form. I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for THAT is to work so hard you can&rsquo;t think about it; and I was enrolled for fall to take an operating systems class in PASCAL.
</p>
<p>So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a new feature. Variable length strings! Wow...
</p>
<p>That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL. I learned more about data structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in all of my years in school. I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria players... All at OU.
</p>
<p>I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born. Jimmey helped out on many of the functions in the game as well. This would have been about Moria 2.0
</p>
<p>In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept making enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and to keep them going. If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and &rsquo;enhanced&rsquo; the game to make it harder. I once vowed it was &rsquo;unbeatable&rsquo;, and a week later a friend of mine beat it! His character, &rsquo;Iggy&rsquo;, was placed into the game as &rsquo;The Evil Iggy&rsquo;, and immortalized... And of course, I went in and plugged up the trick he used to win...
</p>
<p>Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities. Just before a OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the University of Texas... I couldn&rsquo;t resist... I modified it so that the beggar on the town level was &rsquo;An OU football fan&rsquo; and they moved at maximum rate. They also multiplied at maximum rate... So the first step you took and woke one up, it crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of them and pounded you into oblivion... I soon received a call and provided instructions on how to &rsquo;de-enhance&rsquo; the game!
</p>
<p>Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release. I was working on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines (and yes, I still work there). Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and contained many neat enhancements, features, you name it. It had water, streams, lakes, pools, with water monsters. It had &rsquo;mysterious orbs&rsquo; which could be carried like torches for light but also gave off magical aura&rsquo;s (like protection from fire, or aggravate monster...). It had new weapons and treasures... I left it with the student assistants at OU to be finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine. As far as I know, that source was lost...
</p>
<p>I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game. Several people asked if they could convert it to &rsquo;C&rsquo;, and I said fine as long as a complete credit history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold, only given. So I guess one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to rewrite it in &rsquo;C&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from players telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the day I was born... I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it was still standing) talking about the game on VAX&rsquo;s (which supposedly couldn&rsquo;t be there due to export laws). I used to have a map with pins for every letter I received, but I gave up on that!
</p>
<p>I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going... I plan to download it and Angband and play them... Maybe something has been added that will surprise me! That would be nice... I never got to play Moria and be surprised...

<h3 class="section">15.2 Moria and the GPL</h3>

<p>Robert Alan Koeneke, posting to <tt>debian-devel</tt> mailing list.  February 2005
</p>
<p>Ok, I am working on getting the correct GPL statement put together so this
game on all the games based on it don&rsquo;t have any restrictions to
distribution.  It was never my intention to make it hard to share, just to
make certain my name stayed with the game and future variants of it.
</p>
<p>Sheesh, I should have gone into game design I guess.  I had no idea people
were still playing these games.  Did anyone ever add the Moria V5.0 new
features to the game?  Liquids (pools, streams, lava, etc), orbs, and
recipes for building magic weapons?  There were other things but that&rsquo;s the
stuff I remember off-hand.
</p>
<p>In case you can&rsquo;t tell, I am no longer a part of the coding community.  I
moved up the corporate chain to the point of all I do is design enterprise
systems; no one lets me touch code anymore.
</p>
<p>Enjoy.

<h3 class="section">15.3 The Early Days of Umoria</h3>
<p>James E Wilson, posting on <tt>rec.games.roguelike.moria</tt>.  January 2006
</p>
<p>I started work on Umoria in February 1987.  I somehow acquired play
testers in April.  I don&rsquo;t recall exactly how, but I was at a
university, so maybe they saw me playing it on a public terminal and
asked for a copy.  The game slowly spread around the Berkeley area.  By
November, the game was in good enough shape that I could post it to
comp.sources.games.  I think I was still calling it UNIX Moria then, to
distinguish it from the original, but the comp.sources.games moderator
shortened it to Umoria, and that name has stuck.  After the
comp.sources.games posting, the game was widely available, and things
just grew from there.  The Usenet rec.games.moria group was created
sometime around Jan 1, 1988, and was where most of the early discussions
about it occurred.
</p>
<p>I originally got involved with Moria because I was tired of playing
other games.  I spent a lot of time playing games such as rogue and
hack, and was looking for something different to try.  There was a game
called UltraRogue that I enjoyed playing.  Unfortunately, it had some
very frustrating bugs, and it was only available as a binary.  I spent
some time investigating the possibilities of trying to decompile it and
fix it.  Before I got very far, I chanced upon a copy of the VMS Pascal
Moria sources and quickly decided that porting the sources to Unix was a
better project than trying to fix UltraRogue.  After I gained some fame
as the Umoria author, I did manage to get a copy of of the UltraRogue
sources, but by then it was too late, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I had a legal
copy of the sources, so I never did anything with them.
</p>
<p>The original game was written in VAX/VMS Pascal with some VAX/VMS
Assembler.  I did not have access to a VMS machine, and both the Pascal
and Assembler code would not work with Unix because of many uses of VMS
extensions.  Since C was a more common language for Unix anyways, I
decided to just convert the whole thing to C.  Much of the initial
syntax conversion was done via emacs macros.  Then it was just a matter
of tweaking the sources until they would compile.  The hardest part was
finding and fixing all of the off-by-one errors, as Pascal array
indexing starts at 1, and C array indexing starts at 0.  It took me
years to find and fix all of the off-by-one errors.  I still can&rsquo;t
believe how hard it was to find them all.  At least, I hope I found them
all.
</p>
<p>Mostly what I remember about the early years of working on Umoria was
that it was a good introduction to software engineering principles.  I
had to learn how to deal with bugs, bug fixes, release schedules, making
and distributing releases, etc.  It was just a game, but I learned many
valuable lessons about real world software development while working on
it.
</p>
<p>One of my favorite moments from my Umoria years is when I got mail from
one of the authors of rogue.  I recognized the name right away, and had
to ask.  He confirmed that he was one of the rogue authors, and that he
was a fan of Umoria.  That made my day.
</p>
<p>The credits in the PC/Windows game Diablo mention that it was inspired
in part by Umoria.
