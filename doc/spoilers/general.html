<p>
There are many versions of moria.  The most current is version 5.5.2 This
spoiler file is based in the workings of Moria 5.x.  All of the Moria 5.x
play similarly.
<p>
If you are playing version 4.87, then may of the scribblings in this file
will be incorrect for you, and you can either deal with it or upgrade to
the 5x version.  See the FAQ questions for more details, or the Versions
file that comes with moria for a more complete history.
