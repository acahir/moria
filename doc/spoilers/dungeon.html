<a name="city"><h3>The City:</h3></a>

The city is a special part of the game of moria.  You start the game here.  
Unlike other levels of the dungeon, the town is only one screen big and it has
stores that will buy and sell items you find in the store.  There are monsters
on this level, but since it is assumed that you grew up in an environment like
this, you will get zero experience points for killing town creatures.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="stores"><h3>Stores:</h3></a>

There are six kinds of stores on the town level:
<dl>
<dt>General stores:
<dd>sell food, water, cloaks, picks, light sources, and spikes
<dt>Weapon shop:
<dd>sells weapons
<dt>Armor shop:
<dd>sells armor
<dt>Temple:
<dd>Sells potion, scrolls, prayer books, and some bashing weapons
<dt>Alchemists shop:
<dd>Sells potions, scrolls
<dt>Magic shop:
<dd>Sells magic books, wands, staffs, rings, amulets
</dl>
Each store can have a different shopkeeper that will determine base prices, 
haggling difficulty, and overall pleasantness.

<a name="haggling"><h3>Haggling:</h3></a>

Haggling is one of the most irritating skills in the game, according to most
people.  There are been methods of eliminating haggling, or making it an option
in the game.  Here is a detailed method of how to haggle and get the best price
on an item.
<p>
Final offer price
<pre>
             Base cost of item
           * Final offer markup
           * Race adjustment
           * CHA adjustment
          --- Final offer price
</pre>
The initial offer price is the same, except substitute the First instead of 
Final in the second line.
<p>
If the item is unidentified, the price is determined by the table below.  Using
the real price would allow players to identify the relative value of items by
offering to sell them.
<pre>
+---------------------------+
| Unidentified Item | Price |
+---------------------------+
| Weapon or Armor   |  Base |
| Diggers           |  Base |
| Food              |     1 |
| Potion            |    20 |
| Scrolls           |    20 |
| Amulet            |    45 |
| Ring              |    45 |
| Wand              |    50 |
| Staff             |    70 |
+---------------------------+
</pre>
If a wand or staff whose type is known, but not the number of charges, the base
price for the wand/staff is used.
<p>
If a non-cursed type of ring or amulet is known, but not the bonus, then the
price is still the base price of the ring/amulet
<p>
Ration type foods are always identified.  Only molds and mushrooms are above.
<p>
Race adjustment is how well members of two races get along.  The table below
is the percent markup based on the race of the player and the shopkeeper.
<pre>
+----------------Shopkeeper Race-------------------------------------------+
| Player  | Human | H-Elf | Elf | H-ling | Gnome | Dwarf | H-Orc | H-Troll |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Human   |  100  |  105  | 105 |   110  |  113  |  115  |  120  |   125   |
| Half-Elf|  110  |  100  | 100 |   105  |  110  |  120  |  125  |   130   |
| Elf     |  110  |  105  | 100 |   105  |  110  |  120  |  125  |   130   |
| Halfling|  115  |  110  | 105 |    95  |  105  |  110  |  115  |   130   |
| Gnome   |  115  |  115  | 110 |   105  |   95  |  110  |  115  |   130   |
| Dwarf   |  115  |  120  | 120 |   110  |  110  |   95  |  125  |   135   |
| Half-Orc|  115  |  120  | 125 |   115  |  115  |  130  |  110  |   115   |
| Half-Trl|  110  |  115  | 115 |   110  |  110  |  130  |  110  |   110   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
When offering a price, if you didn't increase (decrease for selling) you offer 
by the Haggle% of the shopkeeper, he is insulted.  If you have insulted him
the number of times in the Insult column, he closes his store for 1000 turns.
If you increase it by more than 3*Haggle%, then instead of the shopkeeper 
matching your change, he'll just use 3*Haggle%.  Thus you have just given the
shopkeeper some free money.
<p>
If the number of good haggles - 3* bad haggles - 5 is greater than zero and
it's square is greater than the price/50, haggling is not necessary for that
item.

<a name="underground"><h3>The Underground:</h3></a>

Each level of the underground is filled with rooms,  monsters, and treasure.
These levels are much bigger than the town level, typically 66 high and 198
characters wide.  When you pass through a stair, the old level is destroyed
and a new one created.  There will not be a staircase for you to return to the
old level, after going through a staircase.  You will have to find one on the
level.
<p>

<a name="traps"><h3>Traps:</h3></a>
