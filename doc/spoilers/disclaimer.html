This document (hereafter referred to as the "public" version of the Moria
Spoiler File, or just "the spoilers") is copyrighted material and is *not* in
the public domain.  Permission is hereby granted to you (the user) to 
distribute copies of this document, subject to the following conditions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The spoilers may be electronically distributed only in unmodified form.
    Any such distribution must contian the complete document, including the 
    title page, copyright notices, and this section.
<p>
<li>The spoilers may be distributed in other than electronic form, 
    (specifically, in the form of a printout) only as a direct dump of the 
    complete file.  However, the addition of multiple fonts, line drawings, 
    graphics, margins, column formats, etc is allowed as long as the complete 
    document is provided.
<p>
<li>No fee may be charged for the copying or distribution of the spoilers 
    other than compensation which shall match the cost of materials for that
    distribution (i.e., you cannot charge for the time/labor), not to exceed
    $5 US.  (Examples:  If you were to print the spoilers out for a friend 
    and the paper cost you $0.25, you could ask your friend for $0.25 - not a 
    penny more.)
<p>
<li>The spoilers may not be distributed free in conjunction with any other 
    product without the written consent of the author.  The only exception is 
    that this file may be included in the distribution for any version of 
    Moria for which this document would apply.
