<a name="attributes"><h3>Attributes:</h3></a>
<p>
Moria characters have several attributes that affect how they their character
can survive in the dungeon and interact with monsters.  Many of these have
cryptic relationships to their actual function.  Below is a list of all the
attributes and their contribution to the character.
<p>
The following six attributes, which are the most important, are on a scale
of 3-18, with an additional 'exceptional' value after 18, designated by
a slash, like 18/29.  The maximum value of any attribute is 18/100.  A plain
18 is the same as 18/00.  If a second number is displayed next to the
attribute (like STR:    18  18/29) the second number is your original
value before it was drained by a attribute draining creature.
<p>
STR:  Character strength.

The number of attacks/round it determined by the weight of the weapon, the
STR, and DEX attributes.  S/W = Str divided by the weight of the weapon in
pounds.  Exceptional strength, is added to the 18.  (18/29 = 47)

INT and WIS:  These determine your spell casting ability.  For Mages, Rangers
and Rogues, use the INT stat, and for priests and paladins, use the WIS stat.
<p>
Also, INT gives you a bonus for using devices, as shown in the table below.
Note:  This is for the INT stat, no matter what the class is.  See the wand
and staff section for a complete formula for the chance to use a device
sucessfully.

All characters receive experience during the game.  Experience
determines your level, which determines hit points, mana points,
spells, abilities, etc.  The amount of experience required to 
advance a level is a base value (shown below) plus a penalty
for race and class.

Maximum level is 40 and maximum experience is 9,999,999
<p>
There are penalties to experience to help balance out the classes and
races.  These are listed above and are used to figure out your actual
experience required.
<p>
For example:  For a 10'th level Gnomish Mage to achieve 11'th level
needs:<pre>
           500 *  1.25 * 1.30 = 812.5
         (base) (gnome) (mage)
</pre>
Note:  Even for the worst case (Gnomish Ranger) it is still possible
to achieve the 40th level.  (5,000,000*1.25*1.40=8,750,000 experience)
(Note:  A Gnomish Ranger can't exist, this was just a worst cast scenario)
<p>
The program internally keeps experience out to the second decimal place
even though it only displays the integer portion on the screen.
<p>
There are many ways to gain experience.  This list shows a few.
<ol>
<li>Defeating monsters
<li>Disarming traps
<li>Picking locks
<li>Using a scroll, potion, staff, wand, or rod for the first time
  and discovering what it did.
<li>Casting a spell successfully for the first time.
<li>Drinking a potion of gain experience
</ol>
Identifying objects will give (item level + char level/2) /char level 
experience points.
<p>
Each experience level has a title which is displayed under your name
and class.  Below is a listing of all the titles for each level and
class.
