<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction:</h3></a>
<p>
Once upon a time, there was a game called moria.  It was a pretty good game,
and a lot of people really enjoyed playing it.  As time went by, more people
suggested changes to the game, adding more items, more monsters, and more ways
to die.  This resulted in a difficult game to win.
<p>
As more time went by, news groups were created out of the murk with names like
rec.games.moria where people could gloat over their victories and provide
hints and answers to questions that the ignorant masses posed.  However, once
a question was asked and answered, the piece of advice was lost forever and
would often be reasked in a matter of weeks.
<p>
Within this file is a large collection of lore about the game of Moria.  Some
of it may not be true, but I have made the best effort possible to verify all
of the information contained herein.  Much of it has been verified, corrected,
or added since the start of editing of this document before it was ever posted
to the network.
<p>
Also, we would like to request that any corrections, modifications, 
suggestions, etc.  be E-mailed directly to mrmarcel@eos.ncsu.edu and not
posted to the net.  We will attempt to verify any information sent us and then
we will both add it to the spoiler file (for the next release) and post an
official correction/addition to rec.games.moria.
<p>
Note:  Please do not send E-mail to us asking for a copy of Moria itself (or 
the source code, etc).  We do not honor these requests, and often just ignore 
them.
<p>
Be warned:  If you use the knowledge contained herein, your game will never be
the same.  Your horizons will suddenly be expanded, but you may end up
thinking that the game is less than it once was.  That is the risk you must
take if you choose to read ths file.
<p>
Good luck, and happy adventuring!

<a name="revision"><h3>Revision History:</h3></a>
<p>
In order to keep a decent idea of how the spoiler file is progressing, we have
set up an official policy on how Revision Numbers will change.  Any minor
revisions, corrections, or amplifications will advance the revision number
by .01.  New sections added, or complete re-writes of existing sections will
advance the revision number of .10.  Any complete rewrite of the entire file
(just in case - it might actually happen) will advance the revision number to
the next integer.
<p>
A fairly recent version of the spoilers can be downloaded via FTP from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cis.ksu.edu/pub/Games/Moria/doc/">ftp.cis.ksu.edu</a>
in the directory '/pub/Games/Moria/doc/spoilers*' Because
this FTP site is not under my control, minor changes to the spoilers file
will be saved up.  [FTP administrators don't like it if you bug them with
a new upload every few days.]
<p>
The MOST recent version can be found using WWW to browse through the spoilers
online.  This can be found at:

   http://www.piratehaven.org/~beej/moria/spoilers1.2.html

The Moria Spoilers file was converted to .HTML by 'Beej' and is updated
continuously.  The complete spoilers file can also be downloaded using a link
at this WWW site.  This link will download the newest version of the spoiler
file.

<a name="credits"><h3>Credits:</h3></a>

Well, this should actually be a very large list.  Among others, it should
include almost everyone who has posted any hints of value to the net within
about the last decade.  Some people who have made contributions to the cause
of these spoilers above and beyond the call of duty, however, are listed here:
<dl>
<dd>    Beej!<br>
    Michael Beresis<br>
    Sharon L. Casteel<br>
    William Chuang<br>
    Aaron M. Clements<br>
    James Frye<br>
    David Grabiner<br>
    Maarten Hazewinkel<br>
    Ben Hodson<br>
    Jeremy Seip<br>
    Kevin Souter<br>
    Jon Vessey<br>
    Boudewijn Wayers<br>
    Nicholas C. Weaver<br>
    <p>
    io20084@maine.maine.edu<br>
    petitc@rpi.edu<br>
</dl>
If any of the rest of you out there know you contributed something to the
cause, but don't see your name listed here - don't get us wrong.  It's not
that we're ungrateful!  We probably just nuked your name by mistake!
<p>
Note:  All names are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and not by
order of importance of contribution.

<a name="usage"><h3>Using The Spoilers:</h3></a>

There's really not much to say on this subject, other than a few intuitive
pointers.  How you use the spoilers is simple:  You read them, and apply the
knowledge contained within to your game of moria.
<p>
The section titles tend to be fairly unique, and are always followed by a
colon.  This should make it very simple to get to whatever section you want
quickly.  Just load the file into your editor (or if you're on a unix system,
even use 'more' for that matter), and use the search function to look for the
section.  For instance, from within more or vi, use the slash key ("/") and
what you'd like to search for ("Armor:" for example)>
<p>
This technique is also very useful for finding every reference to a particular
topic.  If you'd like to know about speed in moria, just search for every
occurance of the word "speed" in the file.
