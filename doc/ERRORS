moria.ms should:

the backslashes in the direction table don't show up in the output for
some reason

explain non obvious spells/prayers, many of the priest spells are confusing,
really should have a general section on spells explaining the 'G' command,
how int/wis and level affects number of spells/prayers, how area effect
spells work, centering before casting an area effect spell is very useful
and perhaps other stuff about spells/magic

explain the special inventory/equipment mode?

explain how misc abilities depend on level, give table of class versus
ability showing the relative gain per level values

mention too-heavy weapons?

says nothing about levels and EXP
should mention that level 40 is the highest level that can be reached
