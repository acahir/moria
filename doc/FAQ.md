First, a general guideline for posters. When you post any question related to playing or debugging the game, please give the version number, which you can get during the game by pressing "v".

These are the questions in the Moria Frequently Asked Questions list. Quick answers to some questions are given in parentheses; more detailed answers may be obtained by clicking on the questions.

Many of the answers are only correct for Umoria versions (4.87 and 5.x); I don't know much about the other versions of Moria.
