	* All: Update all copyright/license notices to GPL; Files in
	atari_st/curscomp and mac/scrnmgr still refer to old licenses as
	they are stand-alone programs.

2008-09-01  David Grabiner  <dgrabiner@asselstine.com>

	* config.h: Add new LICENSE file for GPL.
	* dungeon.c (do_command,original_commands), origcmds.hlp,
	roglgmds.hlp: New command ^V to view the GPL.
	* files/news: Added reference to GPL.

2008-06-01  David Grabiner  <grabiner@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* config.h, externs.h, *.c: Include stdio.h and stdlib.h
	unconditionally rather than guarding them and sometimes dealing
	with incorrect prototypes
	* io.c: Include unistd.h for execl() on Unix and linux systems.
	
2008-05-26  David Grabiner  <grabiner@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* config.h: Gave up on ## because it is so ugly in ANSI C.
	
2008-02-22  David Grabiner  <grabiner@alumni.princeton.edu>

	* types.h: use stdint.h to get guaranteed 16-bit and 32-bit types
	rather than relying on the length of a long, which varies by
	compiler.  

	* config.h: use ## operator so that MORIA_LIB works
	correctly.  

	* INSTALL: Note that default install is for Debian, so
	UNIX install needs to copy the Makefile.
	
moria (5.5.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed location of score file from /var/lib/games/moria/scores to
    /var/games/moria/scores per FHS.  (Closes: #115849)
  * Fixed handling of score file on upgrades (do not null it out!).
  * Applied fixes to a few buffer overflows.  (Thanks to Lars Helgeland for
    noticing the overflows and supplying the patches.)  (Closes: #115745)
  * Upgraded policy to version 3.5.6.0.

moria (5.5.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependencies (was compiled against libncurses4, what was I doing
    that day?).
  * Corrected explanation of the 'V' command in moria2.txt (but not in the
    nroff source for that documentation).
  * Removed use of dh_suidregister.

moria (5.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a Build-Depends line.
  * Changed the handling of the build directory for the convenience of
    porters (should have no impact on users).
  * Changed short description so that it does not include the name of the
    package.
  * Corrected path to /usr/games/moria binary in the menu.  Closes: #81353

moria (5.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typos in the control/README.debian file
  * Updated the author's e-mail address in the copyright file
  * Updated the author's web page listed in the README.debian
  * Installed a new version of the FAQ (reflecting the author's move)

 -- Rene Weber <rene_debmaint@elvenlord.com>  Sat, 14 Oct 2000 10:23:48 -0700

moria (5.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Added DEBIAN_LINUX #define to handle code customizations.
  * Needed to include termios.h in io.c
  * All instances of signal() changed to sysv_signal() since libc6 defaults
    to BSD semantics.
  * Instead of redefining getuid, just ifdeffed it out of unix.c
  * Changed LOCK_EX and LOCK_SH definitions in death.c (to avoid
    redefinition warnings).
  * Library files are in /usr/lib/games/moria except for the scores file
    which is in /var/lib/games/moria and the hours file which has been
    renamed to /etc/moria-hours
  * Makefile changed to make the binary setgid instead of setuid, as
    required by Debian Policy 5.10.  None of the code itself needed to be
    touched, since it already relinquished uid and gid in the original code.
  * Saved game file is named ".moria-save" not "moria-save"
