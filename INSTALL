First, you have to put every file in the 'source' directory, and every file
in your machine/OS specific directory into a common directory.  If you are on
a UNIX machine and running csh, the following works nicely if typed from this
directory; note that unix/Makefile is built for Debian, so you need the
original UNIX Makefile to make on other Unix systems.
******
foreach i (source/* unix/*)
ln -s $i $i:t
rm Makefile
ln -s unix/Makefile.unix Makefile
end
******
(If you wish to build the program in a temporary directory, the same command
will work, but you will have to give full pathnames for the source and
unix directories.  If you build the program in a different filesystem than
the one containing the sources, then 'ln -s' will only work if you have
BSD or SYSVR4.    If the 'ln -s' fails, you can use 'ln' or 'cp' instead.)

To compile the program, edit the config.h file and Makefile to change the
names of the files the game uses.  Also, uncomment the appropriate
line for the system you are compiling on. Type make (or build
or whatever) to compile the game.  You may want to edit the 'files/hours' file
to indicate during what hours people are allowed to play the game.  (The
micro versions don't use this file.)

The game needs to be installed setuid on UNIX systems for the scoreboard
to work.  Use the command 'chmod 4511 moria' to do this.
The file scores should be mode 644 with the same owner as moria.
The files hours and news must be publicly readable with mode 444.
(Or just type 'make install' after setting BINDIR and LIBDIR in the
Makefile to appropriate values.)

There are two choices for the key bindings, the original style and
a rogue-like style.  You can choose which one is to be the default
by changing the value of ROGUE_LIKE in config.h.

Moria only has partial support for SYS III.  It probably won't
compile and run under this system without a bit of work.

If your compiler has a seven character identifier limit, the shortnam.sed
file should solve the problem nicely.
