This directory contains two simple utilities for dealing with score files.

The first, prscore, will simply print a list of every score in the given
scorefile to standard output.  The second, delscore, will send a copy of the
scorefile to standard output, except that the nth entry will be deleted.

If you wish to delete an entry from your scorefile, use them as follows.
Run "prscore scorefile" to see every entry in the scorefile.  Note the index
(i.e. rank) of the entry you want to delete.  Then run "delscore scorefile
n > tmp.score" where 'n' is the number of the entry you want to delete.
Then run "prscore tmp.score" to ensure that the scorefile is OK.  You
can then copy the tmp.score file over your current scorefile.

Note: do not try to run "delscore scorefile n > scorefile".  You will lose
your scorefile if you do this.

ERRORS:
1) This has not been well tested.  It may not work for everyone.  It probably
   won't compile on every machine that umoria currently supports without
   a few changes.

2) If people are playing umoria while you use these utilties to edit the
   scorefile, you may lose an entry when copying the new scorefile over the
   old.  These utilities really should lock the scorefile, and then do their
   work inplace.  Meanwhile, to be safe, only do this when no one is playing
   (you can use the hours file to force this), or else do this really really
   fast.

3) It includes parts of save.c to make compilation easier.  This may cause
   this to fail if save.c is modified and these programs aren't.  It really
   should be linked with save.o.

4) It should prompt for the output file name, and then verify that the output
   file and the input file are different, to prevent people from accidently
   destroying their scorefile.  (Or, this can also be fixed by doing all work
   in place.)
