the program is a bit simplistic, as it does not consider monster AC,
and does not correctly handle weapons that are too heavy to wield properly

the README, dragon.inf, and weapons.lst files are probably out of date,
and need to be updated

the README file contains info that doesn't belong here, perhaps create a
hints file in the doc directory that contains this info?
