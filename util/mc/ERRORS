before calling writecreatures in main(), should call a subroutine
verifycreatures, i.e. check to make sure no conflicting bits are set

would prefer 'a' for cchar instead of "a"

prefer exp over xp

prefer 2d4 instead of 2 d 4

should be able to specify none/void or similar for empty slots

need descriptions for all of the monsters
