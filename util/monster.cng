Subject: Corrections to the monster dictionary
Status: RO


I have now made the changes I mentioned to you before, plus a few more
which I discovered in the process.  My current monster dictionary has
161 monsters changed from the original 4.87 copy.  I can send you a copy
of either my dictionary or the diffs if you want them.  However, since
your dictionary is in a different form, and I have a different definition
of "monster," I would suggest that, if you do use my files, you use them
only for reference.

Anyway, here is my current list of changes.

!is a definite bug;
*has been changed.

OK, even though they seem wrong:
Singing, happy drunk moving 20+40+75 random
Ancient red dragon having maximum treasure.
Green ooze not moving.  This is obviously intentional.

Random movement:
Some ants are 20%, others aren't.
Huge brown bat 75%, four others are 20%.
*!Giant fire and giant lightning bat should both be 20% or both be 40%.
 Long-eared, red, lightning changed to 40, huge brown left alone.
*!Giant black centipede should not be 75%, should be 20%.
*Fire elemental is 40%, fire spirit and earth spirit not random.
 All of these made 20.
*Moaning spirit is 20%, banshee is 20% and 40%.
 Moaning spirit made 20+40.
*Clear and bloodshot icky-things should be 40%.
*Killer beetles vary; should they all be 20%?
Should squint-eyed rogue be 20% random?
*!Giant black scorpion should be 20%.
*!Giant brown tick should be 20%.

Doors:
*Fire spirit cannot open doors, fire elemental can and shouldn't.
*Should golems be able to open doors?
*!Oozes shouldn't open doors.
*!Spirit troll should open doors.

Picking up objects:
*!Earth spirit should pick up objects, water elemental shouldn't.
*!Warrior shouldn't unless all people do.

Treasure:
*!Scruffy-looking hobbit should carry gold as well as objects.
Why don't quasits carry gold?
*!Mature green dragon should be 60+90+2d2, not 60+90+1d2.
*!Orc warrior and ogre mage should be 90, like other o's.
*Seedy-looking human 1d2 but nasty little gnome only 90, should be 1d2?
*!Berzerker should be 1d2, not 60; ninja should be 1d2, not 60+90.
*Black knight should be 1d2; sorceror increased to 60+90+1d2, to be
 consistent with liches.
*Should ordinary troll be 60+90, like other trolls?

Spell frequency:
*!Ancient white is the weakest ancient dragon, should be 9 like ancient green.
*!Moaning spirit should be 15, like other ghosts.
*!Orc shaman is 5, ogre mage is 6 and should be 5 or less.
*Should necromancer be 3 rather than 2, since sorceror is 3?

*!Silver jelly and rot jelly shouldn't be harmed by cold.

Why are nagas harmed by poison?

Acid:
*Should flesh golem really be harmed by acid?
*Should green jelly, green worm mass really be harmed by acid?

Blue light:
*Why are flesh golem, giant clear ant, black ooze harmed by light?
*!Rot jelly should be harmed by blue light.
*!Cloud giant should not be.
Should giant purple worm be harmed, like other worms?
*Should all undead, or all intelligent undead, be harmed?
 (Changed to harm L,W,V,G, and spirit troll, not M,s,z.)

*Should it be possible to charm/sleep quasits?

*!White dragon bat should not be seen by infravision.
